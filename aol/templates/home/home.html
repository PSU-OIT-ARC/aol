        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>Oregon has a rich diversity of lakes and reservoirs ranging from some of the clearest lakes in the world, to extremely productive fisheries, to lakes in trouble from pollution. Lakes and reservoirs are very important to the citizens of Oregon as they provide drinking water, flood control, irrigation, power generation, and recreational opportunities such as swimming, boating, fishing, and relaxation.</p><p>The Atlas of Oregon Lakes is a resource for the public, resource management agencies, and scientists to better manage and enjoy our lakes. The online atlas is an updated version of the popular Atlas of Oregon Lakes published in 1985 by the Oregon State University Press.</p>
