"Fish Lake","194","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Fish Lake is a lovely mountain lake situated on the south side of the Wallowa Mountains at an elevation of 6640 feet. It is located just south of the Eagle Cap Wilderness in the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest and is quite remote, reachable only via a long gravel road from Halfway. Originally, a small natural lake existed at the west end of what is now the Fish Lake basin. Early in this century a dam was constructed at the lake's outlet to increase storage capacity for irrigation. Consequently, the deepest part of the lake is at the west end rather than near the dam at the east end as would be expected in an impoundment. There is a one-acre island in the middle of the lake and several large boulders are exposed at the water's surface. Surface runoff from snowmelt on surrounding slopes raises the lake level in spring and early summer, but by late summer the water level drops considerably because of irrigation withdrawals.</p>
<p>In spite of its relative isolation, Fish Lake is popular as a recreation site. However, use is not heavy and it is a good place to avoid crowds. It is regularly stocked with trout and supports both rainbow trout and brook trout. Fish are small, but plentiful. The season is fairly short, with the lake closed to fishing in winter. A good Forest Service campground and a boat ramp are available for visitors on the north shore.</p>
<p>The lake remains in a very pristine condition and the water is very low in mineral concentrations. The concentration of phosphorus is low and the growth of phytoplankton moderate. Water transparency is excellent; the bottom can be seen clearly everywhere in the lake. There is no significant growth of macrophytes although a few willows persist in shallow water near the dam. The lake is well sheltered from the wind and develops a distinct temperature stratification. Oxygen is at saturation at all depths. By all indications Fish Lake is oligotrophic.</p>

"Davis Lake","64","<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Davis Lake is one of the largest of the many mountain lakes on the east slope of the Central Oregon Cascades. It straddles the Klamath/Deschutes county line and lies at an elevation of 4386 feet above sea level. The name Davis is taken from ""Button"" Davis, a nineteenth century stockman from the Prineville area who ran cattle in the vicinity of the lake. Davis Mountain, rising above the lake on the east side, was presumably named for the same man. In 1878 the name was already in use when Lt. T.W. Symons visited the area. His survey report included the first known description of Davis Lake and its valley and pointed out several essential features: the large surrounding meadow, backed by a forest of ponderosa pine; evidence of large fluctuations in water level and surface area; and the lava dam that impounded the waters of Odell Creek to form the shallow lake.</p>
<p>As noted by Symons, Davis Lake is a dramatic product of the recent geologic history of the Central Oregon Cascades, an area of widespread volcanic activity. Odell Creek incised a channel into the surface of a high lava plateau and was later filled by a lava flow several hundred feet thick that impounded the creek, forming Davis Lake. Although the date of this flow has not been determined precisely, it is certainly one of the youngest in the Cascades and may be as recent as 1000 years old. Certainly it is less than 6600 years old, because the flow is not covered by the regional blanket of pumice from Mt. Mazama.</p>
<p>The hydrology of Davis Lake and the physical geography of its drainage basin was well documented by Phillips and Van Denburgh (1968). The drainage basin covers an area of about 111 square miles and reaches a maximum elevation of 8744 feet at the summit of Diamond Peak. The lava plateau slopes gently toward the northeast and is dotted with many cinder cones. A surface deposit of highly permeable pumice overlies all but the most recent deposits and supports an almost continuous forest of ponderosa pine. Infiltration rates into the permeable volcanic material are very high and little surface drainage has developed. Thus, the hydrologic boundary of the basin may not be completely coincident with the topographic basin.</p>
<p>Odell Creek and Ranger Creek, two perennial streams, feed the lake and there is direct surface runoff from snowmelt. Subsurface springs must also contribute inflow. There is no surface outlet, but considerable seepage through the blocky lava dam. During the summer season this output exceeds flow into the lake and the surface area covered by water gradually decreases. High water level usually occurs in June with a two to three foot drop by autumn and considerable reduction in surface area. There is also fluctuation from year-to-year in response to the amount of precipitation in the preceding winter, and to some extent in the two or three previous years. It is not unusual for surface area to vary from 1000 acres to 4000 acres in successive years. Davis Lake is more meadow and marsh than it is lake in drier years. The normal range of water surface elevation in historic times appears to be from about 4376 feet to a high of 4392 feet. Klamath and Deschutes counties and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife combined efforts to seal several sumps along the east side of the lake to reduce water loss (McHugh 1972). Other sumps are known to exist in the bottom of the lake, and water loss through these is the reason that no attempt has been made to raise the lake level for storage, as has been done with many other lakes in the area.</p>
<p>Four miles downstream from the lake at the far end of the lava flow is Davis Creek, fed by a number of large springs whose openings range in elevation from 4310 feet to 4360 feet. Since the construction of Wickiup Dam in 1949, located 10 miles northeast of Davis Lake, these springs are usually submerged except when water level in the reservoir is low. However, this does not appear to influence the flow of these springs. Although the source of this spring flow has not been directly traced, it appears that they are in large part supplied by seepage from Davis Lake. There is a well defined relationship between the flow of the springs and the stage of the lake.</p>
<p>Davis Lake is rich biologically; the bottom material has a high organic content and the production of insects, crustaceans, and other fish food is high. It is well enriched from natural sources (McHugh 1972). As the waters in the lake recede, exposing more wetland, a variety of emergent macrophytes grow in the shallow areas. Grasses surround the lake, and small birds nest in the grasses and willows. Waterfowl habitat is excellent and supports a variety of ducks, geese, swans and sandhill cranes. Davis Lake is an important link in the chain of waterways and feeding grounds that form a major migration route.</p>
<p>Fishing in Davis Lake is excellent. Only fly-fishing is now permitted, thereby reducing pressure on the lake and providing for a quality experience. Baits and lures can be used on Odell Creek. The creek is closed to fishing until the end of May because of spawning rainbow trout. Rainbow trout, some quite large, are taken most commonly in the lake, kokanee also run large, but appear to have declined in&nbsp;numbers in recent years. Landlocked coho salmon are generally self-sustaining, although they have been restocked periodically. The lake was treated in 1961 to kill trash fish. Toxaphene was used and because of the persistence of the toxicant nearly a year passed before restocking was possible. No trace of toxaphene was ever detected in the springs entering Wickiup Reservoir (McHugh 1972). Restocking was with Atlantic salmon, kokanee, and silver salmon. Oregon whitefish also are found.</p>
<p>Much of the ecological character of Davis Lake is determined by its shallow morphometry and fluctuating water level. It is constantly mixed from top to bottom and does not develop any stable thermal stratification. Dissolved oxygen is always plentiful throughout the water column. Major ion concentrations are slightly above average for natural mountain lakes in the Cascades, but are characteristic of lakes in the Cascades surrounded by pumice soils. The concentrations of chlorophyl and phosphorus and the water transparency suggest mesotrophic conditions. Nutrients are readily recycled from the rich organic sediments and stimulate the growth of planktonic algae, also a consequence of the continual mixing of the water column. Additional nutrients are added by migrating waterfowl. The phytoplankton densities reflect mesotrophy, however the species present indicate varying ecological conditions. <em>Anabaena</em> is more common in eutrophic lakes, while <em>Chromulina</em> is most often found in oligotrophic lakes. The phytoplankton also contains many periphytic diatoms (diatoms growing attached to macrophytes on the lake bottom), which are characteristic of shallow lakes.</p>

"Phillips Lake","116","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Phillips Lake in east-central Oregon is the primary component of the Upper Division of the Baker Project, a Bureau of Reclamation project that provides water for the irrigation of agricultural land in the Powder River Valley near the city of Baker. The Lower Division of the project, consisting of Thief Valley Dam and Reservoir, provides a supplemental water supply for about 7300 acres along the Powder River northeast of Baker. Water resource development in the Upper Division has been under study since about 1930, and the present development evolved from an earlier plan that contemplated a valley-wide irrigation district. The irrigated area now served by the Upper Division consists of 18,500 acres adjacent to and north of Baker, and includes some contiguous areas that had previously been dry-farmed. Project benefits also include flood control, fish and wildlife enhancement, and recreation. Construction of Upper Division facilities, including Mason Dam which impounds Phillips Lake, was begun in 1965 and completed in 1968. At full pool the lake is five miles long, covers 2435 acres, and has a capacity of 90,500 acre-feet. The lake was named for Fred Phillips, a prominent Baker resident and long-time advocate of the project.</p>
<p>The 144 square-mile drainage basin contributing to Phillips Lake is mostly within the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest and is covered with a coniferous forest. The Forest Service is charged with management of lands surrounding the lake and has established two campgrounds and two boat launching sites. A small campground is located adjacent to the dam and a very large one, Union Creek Campground, is on the north side of the lake. There are also two designated overflow camping areas at the west end of the lake. Facilities are all accessible from the Sumpter Valley Highway (Highway 220) which flanks the north side of the lake. An unpaved road along the south side of the lake is closed to vehicular traffic. Visitor use at Phillips Lake has been quite heavy since its completion. In addition to use by fishermen and campers, there is also swimming and water-skiing during the summer months. Fishing is particularly good near the dam, although success has frequently been hindered by the presence of rough fish. Recreational use of the lake has been greater than expected and there are definite signs of overuse by visitors. The indiscriminant use of land outside designated camping areas has caused serious damage including soil loss, soil compaction, vegetation destruction, litter and trash, wildlife harassment, and general unsanitary conditions. Most of the damage has been caused by vehicle use.</p>
<p>Upstream from the lake is a region of great historical and natural significance. Much of the Sumpter Valley consists of piles of rock dredged up during a period of intense hydraulic mining earlier in this century. The valley bottom was ruined by this final phase of gold extraction. However, due to some channeling, the area has become prime wildlife habitat, a nesting area for birds, and the year round home for small mammals; deer and elk also winter here. A few artificial snags have been installed on a meadow along the northwestern shore of the lake and serve as nesting sites for eagles and hawks. The Sumpter Wildlife Area is immediately upstream of the lake, a designated area of about 36,000 acres that extends about 11 miles to near the town of Sumpter. The conversion of the Sumpter Valley gold dredge site into a viable wildlife area offers a blueprint for the reclamation of land ravaged by the effects of mining.</p>
<p>The lake basin is characteristic of reservoirs, with the deepest point near the dam at the eastern end, and becoming progressively shallower toward the upstream end of the reservoir; there are numerous small embayments where smaller tributary streams enter. Macrophytes grow in these shallow enbayments, but are not abundant. Also characteristic of reservoirs, the banks are not yet stabilized and turbidity plumes develop from bank erosion when winds create surface waves. The mineral content of the water is moderate; calcium and sulfate are somewhat above average for eastern Oregon reservoirs. The pH is frequently above 8 during the summer as a result of the growth of phytoplankton. In 1970, the most common species of phytoplankton was a diatom, <em>Melosira granulata</em>, which is common in eutrophic lakes (McHugh 1972). A phytoplankton sample collected on 8/16/82 was dominated by<em> Aphanizomenon</em> (a blue-green alga), but the total phytoplankton density was unusually low. This alga was not present in a sample collected three weeks earlier, and may have been increasing on the 8/16/82 sample date. <em>Gloeotrichia</em>, which is a blue-green alga that forms large colonies, was visible but was not abundant in the lake. Phosphorus and chlorophyl concentrations are moderate to high, and water transparency is low to moderate. Surface temperatures can become fairly warm in mid to late summer, but the reservoir remains cool below 100 feet (30 meters). There is some tendency for oxygen depletion in deeper water. Overall, Phillips Lake is mesotrophic in character.</p>

"Waldo Lake","138","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Waldo Lake, located at an elevation of 5414 feet near the crest of the Cascade Range, is one of the largest natural lakes in Oregon. Its surface area of 6298 acres is second only to Upper Klamath Lake (and Agency Lake) among natural non-alkali lakes in the state. It is also the second deepest lake in the state after Crater Lake; maximum depth is 420 feet and the mean depth is 128 feet. The total volume of water in Waldo Lake is nearly 800,000 acre-feet, and it has an extremely long retention time. However, the most outstanding feature of this lake is its ultraoligotrophic character; it is indeed one of the most oligotrophic water bodies in the world. The water is a beautiful cobalt blue color and remarkably clear. Certainly this feature has changed little since the lake was first visited by surveyors in the nineteenth century. Waldo Lake and others nearby were shown as the Virgin Lakes on an 1863 survey map, and it was also at one time known at Pengra Lake. Eventually, the lake was named for Judge John B. Waldo who sought his recreation in the Cascades.</p>
<p>The lake basin, estimated to be 10,000 to 12,000 years old, is a glaciated depression enclosed by end and lateral moraines. This entire section of the Cascades is dotted with lakes in depressions left by the melting of ice sheets at the end of the Pleistocene Epoch. Little surface drainage has developed in the relatively flat, youthful topography. No permanent surface streams enter Waldo Lake, although there is snowmelt runoff through countless temporary streams during spring and early summer. There is also some seepage in from springs on the lake bottom. Almost one-third of the drainage basin consists of the lake itself, and direct precipitation is a major source of water. The lake is the source of the North Fork of the Willamette River, which discharges from the northwest end, and there is another outlet to the southwest. At one time there were plans to install hydroelectric generating equipment at this second outlet, but to date it has not been done. The surrounding landscape is blanketed by a coniferous forest, predominantly Douglas fir, hemlock, and pine. Huckleberry is the principal species of understory vegetation. The thin, porous soil mantle overlies basaltic bedrock and consists of moderately weathered</p>
<p>volcanic ash and boulders from glacial outwash.&nbsp;Generally, the shoreline of the lake is rocky and irregular shaped with numerous indentations. Small sandy beaches are numerous along the eastern shoreline, while the western shore has fewer beaches and is generally steeper.</p>
<p>Prior to 1969 Waldo Lake was accessible only by trail or four-wheel drive vehicle and the majority of users lived within a 100-mile radius. In June of that year a paved road was opened, thus linking the lake with a major highway. Campgrounds were constructed by the Forest Service on the east shoreline and plans made for an all-year recreation site. As a result of the improved access, visitor use has risen dramatically, although it is for the most part confined to the period July 15 to September 15. The Waldo Lake Recreation Area of 32,000 acres is a management unit of the Willamette National Forest, designed to protect the beautiful alpine characteristics of the lake and its surroundings. A network of trails lace the area and vehicle access is restricted. Sail boaters and canoeists find the lake appealing during the short season. Anglers commonly pack into some of the many small, high lakes nearby. Waldo Lake has a lot of kokanee, eastern brook trout and rainbow trout, although populations are small; the most productive areas are in the littoral zone where the fish feed in shallow water near shore.</p>
<p>Waldo Lake is thermally stratified in the summer. The surface water remains cool, 59 to 64 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 18 degrees Celsius) and the thermocline begins at a depth of about 33 feet (10 meters). Because of the lake's considerable depth, heating extends to only about this depth; bottom water is near the temperature of maximum density, 39 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) year round. The chemistry and biology of the water in Waldo Lake are exceptional and clearly classify the lake as ultraoligotrophic. It is the most oligotrophic lake in the state and, as noted by Carter et al (1966),</p>
<p>among the purest lakes in the world. Concentrations of ions, conductivity, and alkalinity are exceptionally low, closely similar to the composition of rain water in a pristine environment. The pH of the lake is slightly acid, also characteristic of uncontaminated rain water which acquires its mild acidity from atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Nutrient concentrations are exceptionally low as well. Bioassay experiments conducted by Powers et al (1975) and Maloney et al (1975) indicate that phosphorus concentrations limit the growth of algae. The population densities of planktonic algae are perennially low, seldom exceeding 50 cells/ml. A few planktonic species of diatoms (<em>Asterionella formosa</em>, M<em>elosira sp, Synedra sp</em>) have been reported, but the commonest species observed all belong to the diatom genus <em>Eunotia</em>, a characteristically benthic or epiphytic species, and the dinoflagellate genus <em>Glenodinium</em>. Patches of aquatic moss (<em>Hygrohypnum</em>) appear at all depths. Much of the very limited primary production in the lake results from the growth of the moss and attached diatoms. Larson (1970a) measured the primary production of the plankton by the sensitive carbon-14 method, and observed some of the lowest productivities anywhere in the world (average of 29 mg C/m2 during summer months); for example, this productivity is less than half the productivity observed in Crater Lake (Larson 1972a). The very pure water and lack of plankton are responsible for the exceptional transparency of the water. Larson (1970a) measured transparency at over 115 feet (35 meters) using a one-meter Secchi disk; other observers consistently report Secchi disk readings of 66 to 100 feet (20 to 30 meters) or more. At noted, natural fish growth in the lake is undoubtedly limited because of the very unproductive planktonic food chain; zooplankton are sparse. In some areas, there are noticeable populations of benthic invertebrates, primarily insect larvae, and this benthic productivity may be vitally important to the maintenance of fish populations.</p>

"Upper Klamath Lake","136","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Upper Klamath Lake, with a surface area of 61,543 acres (over 70,000 acres including Agency Lake), is the largest freshwater lake in Oregon and one of the largest in the United States. It is a natural water body lying in the structural valley known as the Klamath Graben. Including Agency Lake and its connecting channel, it is about 25 miles long and ranges in width from 2.5 to 12.5 miles. It lies east of the Cascade Mountains at an elevation of 4139 feet. The water level is regulated by a low dam constructed in 1917 by the Bureau of Reclamation, which maintains the surface elevation between 4137 feet and 4147 feet. The drainage basin is about 3800 square miles, much of it a mountainous volcanic area covered with pumice deposits derived from the formation of the Crater Lake caldera. Elevations in the basin range from 4147 feet at the lake to over 9000 feet at some of the higher peaks in the Cascade Mountain Range to the west. The mountains create a rain shadow over much of the area, and precipitation varies from as little as 15 inches at lower elevations, to more than 60 inches at higher elevations. Consequently, vegetation also varies; the mountainous regions have forests of Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine and true firs, while the open flatlands are associated with large pumice deposits occupied by grass-shrub communities. Large marshes exist throughout the drainage basin. The Sycan (995 acres) and Klamath Marshes (8121 acres) cover the basins of former Pleistocene lakes and extensive marsh areas surround much of the present Upper Klamath and Agency Lakes. Flora associated with the marsh area is a typical sedge-reed community. Since World War I, large sections of marsh have been reclaimed for agricultural use.</p>
<p>The major tributary of Upper Klamath Lake is the Williamson River, accounting for about 46 percent of the inflow to the lake. The origin of this river is a large spring, and it flows through pasture land before entering Klamath Marsh. The river flowing out of the marsh is a dark brown color due to very high dissolved aquatic humus concentrations. The Sprague River joins the Williamson River just prior to entering Upper Klamath Lake on the north shore. Wood River is the second largest tributary, and drains into Agency Lake and then into Upper Klamath Lake on the north shore. Other tributaries, mostly draining agricultural areas, also enter the lake. The outlet is the Link River flowing out of the south end of the lake into Lake Ewauna and into the Klamath River which eventually enters the Pacific Ocean in northern California.</p>
<p>Upper Klamath Lake fills a vital role in water-resource utilization in south central Oregon. Water from the lake is used for irrigation of reclaimed agricultural land; it is regulated to enhance power generation at the Pacific Power and Light projects on the Link River and farther downstream on the Klamath River at the John C. Boyle facility; also it is used extensively by waterfowl, the marshy habitat being an important stopover during fall and spring migrations on the Pacific flyway. Recreational use of Upper Klamath Lake has always been a major focus, particularly for fishing and boating. However, water-contact sports are discouraged by the poor water quality. Several resorts are located at various places around the lake, especially on the west side near the Lake of the Woods road, and there are numerous public campgrounds, picnic areas and boat launching sites. For the angler, rainbow trout are the major attraction and some very large fish have been caught. Most of the fishing is done along the western shore, from Pelican Bay south to Wocus Bay and most of it close to shore because of rough waters commonly encountered farther out in the lake. In addition to trout, warm-water species also thrive in Upper Klamath Lake. Fishing for trout is allowed all year in the southern part of the lake; the northern part, including Agency Lake, is open only during the normal summer trout season. Two genera of Cyprinidae, blue chub (<em>Gila bicolor</em>) and tui chub (<em>Siphateles bicolor</em>), constitute 90 percent of the fish population in the lake.</p>
<p>The maximum depth of Upper Klamath Lake is over 50 feet at several rather confined areas of deep water along the west shore. However, most of the lake is shallower than 20 feet. The concentrations of major ions are slightly above average, as is the conductivity. The concentration of phosphorus in the water is quite variable with the season, but is always high. The inflow to the lake from the Williamson River carries a high concentration of phosphorus derived from natural springs and from surface runoff. The sediment on the bottom of the lake is quite thick, is very rich in phosphorus and other nutrients, and is a significant source of nutrients. The most unusual aspect of the chemistry of the lake is the seasonal influx of dissolved organic matter (humic substances) derived from the Klamath Marsh through which the Williamson River passes on its way to Upper Klamath Lake.</p>
<p>Although situated in beautiful natural surroundings, there has never been much development on the shoreline of the lake because of the massive summer blooms of highly offensive blue-green algae. Severalstudies have indicated that the blooms are entirely natural and maintained by enormous supplies of nutrients contained in the bottom deposits and probably by additional supplies originating in the Klamath and Sycan Marshes and delivered to the lake via the Williamson River. The overwhelming dominant alga is <em>Aphanizomenon flos-aquae</em>, which is a blue-green alga that forms large colonies that resemble ""grass clippings"". It begins to appear throughout the lake in late spring, and continues to increase to very high densities (as high as 30,000 filaments per ml) by late summer. In early fall, nearly all of the <em>Aphanizomenon</em> die, and the decomposition of this large amount of biomass creates undesirable conditions such as dissolved oxygen depletion and strong unpleasant odors. The timing of the annual <em>Aphanizomenon </em>bloom (i.e., dates of appearance and decline) has been correlated with the flow of the Williamson River (Perdue et al 1982). Outflow from the humus-rich Klamath Marsh ceases each summer; during dry years the flow ceases earlier than during wet years. The <em>Aphanizomenon</em> in Upper Klamath Lake follows this same pattern; in dry years the bloom starts earlier than in wet years. No explanations were provided, but the strong correlation suggests an influence of the Williamson River upon <em>Aphanizomenon</em> in Upper Klamath Lake. The densities of <em>Aphanizomenon</em> vary from place to place in the lake; a few bays have very high densities, marshy areas tend to have lower densities, and winds may concentrate the algae near downwind shores. The phytoplankton samples in this survey in 1982 were collected near Eagle Point where the maximum depth is found; the phytoplankton densities were much lower here than in most other sections of the lake. Although only 206 filaments of <em>Aphanizomenon</em> per ml at Eagle Point were measured on 8/22/82, nearby Shoalwater Bay had an extremely high Aphanizomenon density, sufficient to thickly cover the water surface. In winter <em>Cryptomonas erosa</em> is most abundant, followed by <em>Stephanodiscus astrea</em> minutula during early spring. Other common species of phytoplankton include&nbsp;<em style=""border-style: initial; border-color: initial;"">Gloeotrichia echinulata, Anabaena&nbsp;</em>circinalis, <em>Anacystis aeruginosa, Asterionella formosa</em> and <em>Melosira</em>.</p>
<p>Other problems associated with this hypereutrophic lake are an overabundance of midges and dense beds of macrophytes. The midge larvae (Chironomus) grow in bottom sediments where the water is shallow, which is most of the lake. The adults swarm and create a serious nuisance to humans on and near the lake. Many shallow bays, particularly Pelican Bay, are covered with the macrophyte Potamogeton crispus; these aquatic weeds seriously deter boating traffic.</p>
<p>Upper Klamath Lake has come under study several times during the past few decades in the hope that solutions to these problems might be found. The most recent study was performed during 1981-1983, and was funded by EPA through the Clear Lakes Program (Klamath Consulting Service 1983). This EPA-funded study investigated several lake restoration (""manipulation"") alternatives aimed at reducing the algal bloom and macrophyte problems, as well as addressing navigation problems resulting from low water levels. Three sections of the lake were identified as possible sites that may benefit from restoration technology. The southern part of the lake receives the largest amount of recreation, as it is nearer to the population center of the area. The major problem here is the inability of boats to navigate during low water periods, hence recreation and tourism suffer seriously. Howard Bay is another area that receives extensive recreational activity; dense algal blooms occurring here deter these activities. The third area receiving attention under the study was Pelican Bay, where extensive macrophyte growths (<em>Potamogeton crispus</em>) deter navigation and degrade water quality.</p>
<p>The primary restoration alternative proposed was to maintain the minimum lake level three feet higher than is presently maintained. This would greatly benefit the navigation problems in all areas of the lake, and an improvement in water quality would be likely. The study monitored water quality conditions for two years: 1981 was a drought year and the lake level was low, but 1982 was a wet year and higher lake levels existed. The water quality was better in 1982 with higher lake levels than in 1981 when the lake was shallower. To maintain a higher lake level, additional water supplies would be needed during summer; an off-stream storage project presently under consideration would meet this requirement. Other restoration alternatives are specific to the three sites mentioned above. These include dredging a channel in the south part of the lake, dredging either a 3000 acre area or a channel in Howard Bay, flushing Howard Bay in the event off-stream storage water becomes available in the future, and harvesting and/or screening the macrophyte beds in Pelican Bay.</p>
<p>It must be emphasized that Upper Klamath Lake is a naturally hypereutrophic lake, and that any restoration activity would only lessen the problems inherent in this lake and could not resolve or eliminate them. Nevertheless, restoration alternatives, although costly, may improve conditions in Upper Klamath Lake sufficiently to benefit water quality, recreation and navigation.</p>

"Platt 1 Reservoir","252","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Platt I Reservoir was built for flood control and irrigation supply in the late 1960s. It consists of a 33-foot high earthfill dam which impounds the waters of Sutherlin Creek and tributaries. It is exceptionally shallow with a maximum depth of only slightly over 12 feet at full pool; over half the reservoir is shallower than five feet. Water levels drop during the summer and stay quite low in the winter. As a result cattails and other emergent macrophytes encroach upon the water, covering nearly half the surface. Most of the rest of the bottom is covered with submerged macrophytes.</p>
<p>The contributing drainage basin is primarily private land with much of it in use as pasture and farm land. There are some patches administered by the Bureau of Land Management. The shoreline of the reservoir is entirely in private ownership, although public access is permitted and one paved boat ramp is available. It has become an excellent fishing spot and is open year round. Rainbow trout, crappies, bluegill, largemouth bass, and catfish make up the catch.</p>
<p>The reservoir is too shallow to develop a distinct temperature stratification and the water becomes quite warm in the summer. The concentrations of major ions in the water are exceptionally high. Except for coastal lakes and a few lakes in the Basin and Range area of south-central Oregon, Platt I Reservoir is one of the saltiest in the state. The source of these ions is unidentified, but the high concentration appears to be characteristic of waters in the area; nearby Cooper Creek Reservoir is also saltier than is typical. Concentrations of chlorophyl and phosphorus, as well as water transparency, are average and indicate mesotrophic conditions.</p>

Tributaries also include Eel and Marsh Creeks which flow into the east and west arms of the lake. &nbsp;The lake’s outlet, Eel Creek, joins Tenmile Creek about a mile below Tenmile Lake before flowing into the Pacific. &nbsp;Eel Lake, like many other lakes on the Oregon Coast was formed by a series of geological events that included changes in sea level and movement of coastal dunes.</span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Nearly all the shoreline of Eel Lake drops precipitously to a flat bottom of over eighteen meters deep.

"Bully Creek Reservoir","162","<p>(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Bully Creek Dam and Reservoir are located on Bully Creek in eastern Oregon, about eight miles from the creek's confluence with the Malheur River. There are several stories concerning the origin of the name of this stream, all apparently related to the fact that when a man fell into its waters many years ago, his friends stood around and cried out ""Bully! Bully!"" The reservoir is a component of the Bureau of Reclamation's Vale Project which furnishes irrigation water to about 35,000 acres of land near the town of Vale. The project also includes Agency Valley Dam and Beulah Reservoir and the Warm Springs Dam and Reservoir. The 121-foot high Bully Creek Dam was built in 1963. When full, the reservoir is about 1000 acres in surface area with an active capacity of nearly 30,000 acre-feet. Primary inflow is from Bully Creek, but excess water from the Malheur River is also diverted into the reservoir through the Vale Main Canal and the Bully Creek Feeder Canal. Water stored in the reservoir is delivered by two laterals, one beginning at the outlet works of the dam and the other at Bully Creek Diversion Dam about a mile downstream from the reservoir. In addition to irrigation storage, there is specific storage space for flood control purposes and it is instrumental in reducing floods along Bully Creek and on the Malheur River below the mouth of Bully Creek. </p>
<p>Bully Creek Reservoir lies in a narrow, curving valley bounded on both sides by steep hills. The drainage basin is, for the most part, a semi-arid rangeland, most of it federal land administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Recreation facilities include a campground, swimming beach, and boat launching and mooring facilities. Anglers have found excellent catches of white crappie, yellow perch, black bass, and rainbow trout in the reservoir, although there is a continuous problem with rough fish. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife treated the whole stream system for rough fish before Bully Creek was filled and restocked with game fish; it was treated again in 1973. Migratory waterfowl also use the reservoir with some ducks remaining to nest. </p>
<p>Bully Creek is classified as eutrophic. The major ion and total phosphorus concentrations are both higher than most other reservoirs in the area. Phytoplankton densities are high; McHugh (1972) reported mostly diatoms in November, with Aphanizomenon present. He speculated that the Aphanizomenon was a remnant of a summer bloom. An early summer nanophytoplankton sample (6/25/82) consisted of algae that occur in any trophic category, and are thus of no indicator value. However, a net phytoplankton sample collected on this date contained Anabaena, Ceratium, and Pediastrum, all of which indicate eutrophic conditions. Even though the reservoir was not stratified in June, a significant depletion of dissolved oxygen was evident. Due to water level fluctuations, macrophytes are not abundant in the reservoir.</p>","17050118002409","","146133178","01158859","Bully Creek Reservoir","4"
"Cottage Grove Lake","175","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Cottage Grove Lake is a multi-purpose reservoir on the Coast Fork of the Willamette River. It is one of thirteen Corps of Engineersmulti-purpose water projects in the Willamette Valley. The primary function of Cottage Grove Lake, in concert with nearby Dorena Lake, is to control flooding on the Coast Fork as well as to help reduce floodstages farther downstream on the mainstem of the Willamette. It was estimated in 1977 that the presence of Cottage Grove Lake had prevented over $64,000,000 in flood damages since its completion in&nbsp;1942. The reservoir is maintained near full pool until after mid-summer. By August a gradual draw-down begins and by November it is at a minimum level to provide storage for potential flood waters.</p>
<p>This reservoir does not exhibit the typical branching pattern of so many impounded water bodies. The relatively flat topography of its valley is reflected in the regular shoreline, a fact that is most apparent after the fall draw-down when the surface area of the water is reduced to about 25 percent of its maximum. At this time extensive mudflats are exposed and access to the lake restricted. Although the shoreline of the lake is managed by the Corps of Engineers, about half of the forested drainage basin is private land and the rest is federal land managed by the Bureau of Land Management.</p>
<p>Cottage Grove Lake is very popular for all water-based recreation activities, especially boating. Trout are stocked by the state each year and the lake is also managed for warm-water game fish, primarily largemouth bass and black crappie. The Corps of Engineers has provided four parks for camping, picnicking and boat launching.</p>
<p>The Black Butte mine, two miles south of the lake and in its drainage basin, was once one of the largest producers of mercury in Oregon, and there has been a problem with natural deposits in the area yielding mercury to the lake. Analyses of fish tissue by the Department of Environmental Quality have shown that mercury levels in the fish are near levels at which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would require action. Arsenic has also been reported in the area, primarily in the groundwater immediately downstream from the dam and upstream at London Springs.</p>
<p>A pronounced thermal stratification develops in Cottage Grove Lake during summer. Because the control outlet on the dam is near its base, cool hypolimnetic water is selectively withdrawn and only warmer epilimnetic water remains in the reservoir after it has been drawn down. Trophic indices, based on chlorophyl, phosphorus and water transparency indicate that the Cottage Lake is more oligotrophic than other reservoirs in the region. However, it develops a pronounced oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion and is reported to support a considerable production of fish. These factors imply that the lake is more eutrophic than suggested by the indices and it is therefore classified as mesotrophic.</p>

"Fourmile Lake","200","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Fourmile Lake, so named because it was erroneously assumed to be four miles long, is a large natural lake scenically located at the foot of Mt. McLoughlin near the divide between the Klamath River and Rogue River Basins. At 5744 feet above sealevel it is one of the highest lakes in Oregon. The lake was enlarged artificially by the construction of a rock-faced, earthfill dam completed in 1922. Natural outflow is into Fourmile Creek, but a considerable portion of the water is diverted into the Cascade Canal and transported to the Rogue River Basin where it discharges into a lava bed one and one-half miles above Fish Lake. Here the flow sinks into the lava and reappears as springs at the head of Fish Lake. This diversion project is a component of the Medford Irrigation District which supplies irrigation water to the Ashland-Medford area.</p>
<p>Due to a naturally low level of biological production in the lake, it is stocked regularly by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and thus has a variety of fish species. Kokanee are probably the most numerous; eastern brook and rainbow trout are also in good supply. Because of its natural beauty Fourmile Lake is a favorite with many fishermen and other outdoor enthusiasts. A good Forest Service campground is located at the south end of the lake.</p>
<p>Fourmile Lake is surrounded by steep, forested slopes and the lake itself is very deep (maximum 175 feet) with relatively little shallow water. Because of the high elevation, water temperatures remain cool throughout the summer. The water in the lake has very low concentrations of ions, and low alkalinity and low conductivity. Phosphorus and chlorophyl concentrations are also low, and the water is very transparent. By all measures this lake is oligotrophic. Biological productivity as noted is accordingly low and limits natural fish production. A plankton tow taken on 7/15/82 yielded little more than a few copepods. <em>Dinobryon bavaricum</em> and <em>Tabellaria fenestrata</em> have been observed in previous samples. The only apparent macrophyte was <em>Subularia aquatica</em>, a small submergent plant commonly found in mountain lakes.</p>

"Green Peter Lake","204","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Green Peter Lake is one of 13 multi-purpose reservoirs built and operated by the Corps of Engineers in the Willamette Valley. Construction began on the dam and on Foster Dam downstream in 1961 and was completed in 1968. Green Peter Dam on the Middle Santiam River is a 380-foot, concrete structure with a gated spillway for regulation of lake levels. The powerhouse contains two generator units and the 80,000 kilowatt plant is run during periods of peak power demand. Consequently, large fluctuations in flow occur downstream on the Middle Santiam River. Foster Lake absorbs these fluctuations by impounding and releasing the water more uniformly. The project has prevented millions of dollars in damage from downstream flooding since its completion. Green Peter Lake has not developed a particularly strong reputation for fishing and at present the catch consists mainly of rainbow trout. As stocking continues it will certainly draw more anglers. Boat launching and day use facilities have been provided by Linn County and the Corps of Engineers, although launching is difficult at low water.</p>
<p>The highly irregular shoreline of Green Peter Lake is typical of reservoirs and also testifies to the rugged topography of this portion of the western Cascades. The 38 mile perimeter is characterized by precipitous slopes, narrow tributaries and high forested ridges. Land iri the drainage basin is managed, in part, by federal agencies (Willamette National Forest, Bureau of Land Management) and, in part, by private interests. Most of the private land consists of forested slopes near the lake. The Corps of Engineers administers the shoreline.</p>
<p>The water column in the lake develops a distinct temperature stratification in summer. Intakes for the power plant are located in the deeper, cooler water so that water discharged downstream is cooler in the summer than would otherwise be the case. The chemistry of the water in the lake is typical of Cascade drainages: dilute and soft. Phosphorus and chlorophyl concentrations are low, and water transparency is average, indicating mesotrophic conditions. Phytoplankton species, however, are diatoms typically occurring in lakes of higher trophic states. Blooms of phytoplankton have not been reported nor have excessive growths of macrophytes.</p>

"Prineville Reservoir","118","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Prineville Reservoir is one of the major components of the Bureau of Reclamation's Crooked River Project which lies north and west of Prineville, Oregon. Project features include Arthur it. Bowman Dam and Prineville Reservoir, Ochoco Dam and Reservoir, a diversion canal and headworks on the Crooked River, Lytle Creek Diversion Dam and Wasteway, two major pumping plants, nine small pumping plants, the Ochoco Main Canal, and distribution canals. The project provides several benefits to this portion of Oregon: more than 20,000 acres of land are irrigated by waters stored in the two reservoirs; flood protection is provided for Prineville and adjacent farmland areas; recreation use of the reservoirs has been heavy; and the upper end of Prineville Reservoir has been designated a wildlife management area, a 3800 acre area of land and water that provides habitat for a variety of wildlife including numerous species of waterfowl.</p>
<p>Ochoco Dam and Reservoir were constructed in 1918-20 and rehabilitated by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1949-50. Construction of Arthur R. Bowman Dam (originally known as Prineville Dam) began in 1958 and was completed in 1961. It is an earthfill structure, 245 feet high, on the Crooked River about 20 miles upstream from Prineville. Prineville Reservoir has a total capacity of about 160,000 acre feet and a water surface area of over 3000 acres at full pool elevation. It is a long narrow impoundment conforming to the shape of the steep-sided Crooked River Canyon. It extends 18 miles upstream, with 41 miles of shoreline. The Crooked River is the principal source of water, supplying more than 90 percent of the inflow. Bear Creek, entering from the south, is the major tributary, and there are several other small, intermittent streams that enter the reservoir directly.</p>
<p>The drainage basin above the dam is an area of about 2700 square miles, although about 20 percent of this is interior drainage that does not contribute. It consists essentially of the eastern two-thirds of Crook County, with minor acreages in other counties. Elevations range from 3235 feet above sea level at the dam to over 6000 feet in the Ochoco and Maury Mountains. There are concurrent variations in climate, vegetation, and land use. Most of the area is a semi-arid rangeland, with forest cover at higher elevations. There is also a substantial amount of irrigated agricultural land flanking the lower reaches of the Crooked River. Geology of the area is quite variable and includes some of the oldest bedrock in Oregon. Large portions of the basin are underlain by basic lavas and tuffs, while much older marine sedimentary formations underlie the headwaters of the Crooked River.</p>
<p>Prineville Reservoir has become one of the major recreation resources of Central Oregon. This development was unanticipated and occurred because a number of good water years permitted the maintenance of a relatively full reservoir. Crook County administers the shoreline along the lower reach of the reservoir for public recreation and has constructed several boat ramps and a primitive campground. The county has subleased two areas, one to the state of Oregon for a state park and the other to a concessionaire for development of a resort. Prineville State Park consists of a developed campground with shower facilities, a boat-launching ramp, a marina, and a day-use area. The campground is one of the most heavily used in the state. The resort operated by the concessionaire includes a motel, a marina, a beach, rental boats, and a combined store and restaurant. Two residential subdivisions have been developed on private lands adjacent to the reservoir area and several developments of both residential and recreational homes have been built nearby. Fishermen have had very good success at Prineville Reservoir, which is stocked regularly with rainbow trout and largemouth bass. Catfish are also present in the lake and some cutthroat trout have been stocked in recent years.</p>
<p>The limnological characteristics are heavily influenced by the presence of inorganic turbidity, a problem attributed to the siting of the reservoir. Turbidity is a water quality problem throughout the Crooked River system, and it affects the reservoir and reservoir releases. As noted, it is a large drainage basin and contains diverse soil and rock types with a variety of land use activities. Many of these soil types are prone to erosion and the generation of turbid runoff. Land use activities accelerate the erosion of fine soil and sediment; logging practices, fire prevention techniques, road building, and cattle grazing all contribute to increased sediment discharge to the river. Perimeter erosion around the shoreline is also a factor. There are many exposed points and headlands and the waters near the shoreline are particularly turbid, a situation that is aggravated during the months of heavy' recreational use. Heavy boat traffic creates surface waves which accelerate erosion along the shoreline; the waves also resuspend bottom sediments from the exposed shallow areas of the reservoir. Sediment transport to the reservoir is highly dependent on the surface runoff regime and therefore quite variable throughout the year. The total mass of sediment transported to the reservoir may exceed one half million tons per year. Most of it is very fine clays of the montmorillite group. Because of the fineness of the soil particles and the lack of chemicals in the water to make particles flocculate, the reservoir remains turbid for long periods after runoff has entered. The soil particles settle towards the bottom eventually, but since the outlet is near the bottom some of the most turbid water is released into the Crooked River. Identification of specific sources of the clay has not been made and until revegetation of these sources occurs, the turbidity problem will persist.</p>
<p>The concentrations of major ions and the conductivity in Prineville Reservoir is greater than average for reservoirs in Oregon. The reservoir develops a distinct thermal stratification during the summer, with a thermocline at 33 to 50 feet (10 to 15 meters) depth. The epilimnion gradually becomes somewhat more transparent over the summer, but the hypolimnion remains turbid. The highest water transparency (Secchi disk depth of 10 feet; 3 meters) observed in 1982 occurred in August; during most of the year water transparency is limited to 5 feet (1.5 meters) or less by the inorganic turbidity. The inorganic turbidity may retard the growth of planktonic algae. Most reservoirs in Central Oregon support summer blooms of the blue-green alga <em>Aphanizomenon</em>. <em>Aphanizomenon</em> blooms occur in Prineville Reservoir, but less frequently than in other similar reservoirs. The timing of these blooms is also different in Prineville Reservoir than in other eastern Oregon reservoirs. Phytoplankton measurements in this study, as well as those made by McHugh (1972), show that the <em>Aphanizomenon</em> bloom does not develop until autumn. The reason for this delay is unknown, but may be related to the turbidity. In November 1982, <em>Anabaena</em> was almost as abundant as <em>Aphanizomenon</em>. (Note: <em>Rhodomonas minuta</em>, although numerically dominant, is quite small and thus contributes little to the total biomass.) During spring and summer, the phytoplankton is dominated by diatoms; most of these diatoms are periphytic (that is, growing attached to a substrate), and are not typical of lakes. These diatoms may be associated with the suspended clays that are derived from the drainage basin. The chlorophyl concentration and especially the phytoplankton densities are unusually low. In August, 1982, the total phytoplankton density was only 6 per ml.</p>
<p>Macrophytes in Prineville Reservoir are absent or scarce due to rocky littoral areas, water level fluctuations, and limited water transparency. The reservoir is classified as eutrophic primarily because of the limited light transparency and the elevated Concentrations of phosphorus. Chlorophyl concentrations are consistently low compared with the phosphorus and water transparency data. The low chlorophyl concentrations and reduced frequency of plankton blooms suggest light limitation.</p>

"Breitenbush Lake","159","<p>(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Breitenbush Lake lies on a high plateau near the crest of the Cascade Mountains. It is one of numerous lakes in a glaciated basin north of Mt. Jefferson. Olallie Lake, about three miles north, is the largest in this area, and thus lends its name to this section of the Cascades. Breitenbush Lake was named for the river, in turn named for John Breitenbush, pioneer hunter of the North Santiam region. The name was applied to the river in the fall of 1872 by John Minto's official exploring party and is also used for other features in the area such as the Breitenbush &nbsp;Hot Springs and Post Office.</p>
<p>The volcanic terrain yields relatively little surface flow. Small creeks feed Breitenbush Lake, but most of the inflow is a result of seepage. Outflow is apparently limited to a channel shared with a nearby small pond, but surface flow does not appear to be continuous. On many maps, outflow is shown directly into the North Fork of the Breitenbush River. Topographic relief is the surrounding area is gentle to the north and east and more rugged to the west and south where Campbell Butte rises. A dense, mixed conifer forest blankets the landscape.</p>
<p>Skyline road, a popular summer route through the Cascades, passes through the Olallie Lake area and permits access to the gravel road leading to Breitenbush Lake. This route is generally closed by snow until June, but through the summer this scenic area receives much use by Oregonians. Fishing is reported to be excellent at times and the lake is stocked periodically. There is some natural production of brook trout and rainbow trout.</p>","17090005000753","","123427164","01138592","Breitenbush Lake","6"
"Fish Lake (196)","196","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Fish Lake is a small, remote alpine lake located high on the west slope of Steens Mountain in southeast Oregon. Steens Mountain was heavily glaciated during the Pleistocene Epoch and the landscape at higher elevations clearly shows the imprint of this activity. Several small lakes, of which Fish Lake is the largest, exist in depressions scoured out by the ice. The depressions are closed at their lower ends by glacial moraines, which impounded surface runoff to form the lakes. Fish Lake thus sits at the head of Fish Lake Valley, a classic U—shaped glacial trough. Its small drainage basin is relatively undisturbed and covered with alpine grasses and deciduous trees. Although it is only 16 acres in size, Fish Lake is nevertheless the largest mountain lake in the entire Malheur Lake Basin and for this reason attracts fishermen and campers from a large area. It is stocked annually with rainbow trout and has some eastern brook trout from previous stocking; lots of fish are caught. The Bureau of Land Management has developed a nice recreation area with campsites and picnic sites on the shoreline.</p>
<p>The lake basin has a simple oval shape, and the greatest depth (30 feet) is located near the center. It is well sheltered from the wind and the water develops a pronounced thermal stratification. When visited in the summer of 1982, it was observed that the surface water was sufficiently transparent for light to penetrate below the thermocline, resulting in significant plant growth and a mild oxygen supersaturation in the hypolimnion. In other years, surface blooms of algae have reduced water transparency and there has been a corresponding oxygen deficit in the hypolimnion. This variation in the oxygen concentration in the hypolimnion is somewhat surprising for a lake located in an alpine setting. The concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyl are also higher than would be expected. It appears that permeable soils around the lake permit seepage of nutrients from the many pit toilets at the camp sites. This cultural contribution to nutrient input has probably caused a decline in water quality of the lake and thereby stimulated a fairly productive food chain. Based upon phosphorus and chlorophyl concentrations and the variable oxygen supply, Fish Lake is classified as mesotrophic.</p>

"Island Lake","213","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Island Lake is one of numerous small, alpine lakes situated at about 6000 feet elevation in the southern Oregon Cascades. It lies in the Sky Lakes Area, a <em>de facto</em> wilderness which straddles the Cascade crest and is administered jointly by the Rogue River National Forest and the Winema National Forest. The Area is currently under consideration for inclusion in The National Wilderness Preservation System. Such a designation for this idyllic region of 116,343 acres would insure the continuation of the wilderness characteristics that make it so appealing. The natural environment is beautiful: glaciers and volcanic activity have both left their marks clearly on the landscape. More than 200 water bodies, ranging from mere ponds to shallow lakes of 30 to 40 acres, are scattered across the terrain, all a legacy of the ice sheets that covered the mountains thousands of years ago. A number of volcanic peaks dominate the skyline. Vegetation in the area is that of a typical coniferous forest composed of a variety of species, including mountain hemlock, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce at higher elevations and species of pine at lower elevations.</p>
<p>Island Lake, named for the single large island in its center, is one of the largest lakes within the Sky Lakes Area. Like most of the others it is shallow; the average depth is less than 5 feet and the maximum depth is 21 feet. No surface inflow or outflow is reported, typical for this volcanic area where groundwater movement dominates. The lake lies just off the Pacific Crest Trail and thus receives frequent use by hikers. Fishing is excellent; fly fishing is the most popular form because of the large amount of shoal area. Eastern brook trout are the most common species and are stocked each year by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. Several good, unimproved campsites are found around the lake.</p>
<p>The concentrations of major ions, alkalinity, and conductivity in Island Lake are very low and indicate ultraoligotrophic conditions. However, biological indicators (chlorophyll and total phosphorus, for example) suggest the lake is oligotrophic. Apparently, the water is moderately enriched with phosphorus from the sediments, a situation not uncommon in shallow lakes, and the phytoplankton are able to reach a moderate density. This, in turn, supports a productive food chain resulting in good fishing. There is no evidence that human activity has either supplied phosphorus to the lake or adversely affected the water quality in any other way.</p>

"Lake Lytle","229","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Lytle Lake is a small, but highly visible coastal lake located between Tillamook and Cannon Beach on the heavily traveled Oregon Coast Highway. The name is taken from E. E. Lytle, a prominent railroad financier of the early Oregon scene. Among his other accomplishments, Lytle was responsible for construction of the Pacific Railroad and Navigation Line from Hillsboro to Tillamook Bay in 1911. The line is now owned by the Southern Pacific Company. The lake basin represents a low spot on a marine terrace, blocked from the ocean by a low sand dune ridge that parallels the coast. Surface inflow is from several small creeks, and the intermittent outflow is north through Moroney Canal to Crescent Lake and from there to the ocean. Seasonal variation of the lake level is from one to two feet.</p>
<p>The drainage basin for Lytle Lake consists primarily of private timberland, much of it previously logged. Dense brush and second-growth timber now cover the hillsides. Tillamook County owns the lake and most of the shoreline and maintains a boat launch on the northeast shore. A few homes are near the shoreline at the north end. Rainbow and cutthroat trout are stocked heavily, and the lake hosts a fair largemouth bass population. Fishing is a popular sport because of the ready accessibility.</p>
<p>Typical of coastal lakes in Oregon, Lytle is quite shallow and is somewhat enriched with sodium and chloride from sea spray. Conductivity and alkalinity are slightly above average for coastal lakes. Because of its shallowness, the lake is generally well-mixed and unstratified. The entire bottom of the lake is a firm mixture of sand and mud and is covered with macrophytes, primarily <em>Anacharis</em> (<em>Elodea</em>), which reduce the area of open water, especially at the south end. Lytle Lake has received very little attention from scientists, and little data is available. However, by all indications the biological productivity of the lake is not very high, and it is classified as mesotrophic.</p>

It was formed in the mid-1960s with the construction of a 73-foot high earthfill dam on Cottonwood Creek. It is reported to have a capacity of 3700 acre-feet, but when mapped in August 1982 it was more than 20 feet below full pool and held less than half this volume. Irrigation storage is the primary use of the water, thus the water level drops considerably through the summer as withdrawals are made and delivered to irrigated agricultural land downstream on Cottonwood Creek.</p>
<p>The headwaters of Cottonwood Creek are in forested land within the Malheur National Forest, while in the lower reaches is land administered by the Bureau of Land Management. The reservoir itself is entirely on B.L.M. land. Fish have grown well in Cottonwood Reservoir since it was first stocked in the 1960s; however, there has been relatively little angling activity. No facilities have been provided for visitors, although improvements are planned.</p>
<p>Cottonwood Reservoir is eutrophic; it has high concentrations of major ions and total phosphorus. The bottom of the reservoir is mud, and wave action sometimes gives rise to turbid water. Water transparency is reduced by both the suspended sediment and an abundance of phytoplankton (<em>Aphanizomenon flos-aquae</em>) blooms. In 1982, the reservoir was stratified as early as June 23, with the thermocline about 16 feet (5 meters) deep. Dissolved oxygen in the hypolimnion was near saturation levels; however, lower dissolved oxygen concentrations would be expected later in the summer. Water levels fluctuate greatly, and this prevents establishment of macrophytes.</p>

"Lake Selmac","260","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Selmac Lake is a reservoir formed in 1961 by the construction of a 34-foot high earthfill dam across McMullin Creek, tributary to Deer Creek. The dam is seven miles upstream from Deer Creek's confluence with the Illinois River. Selmac Lake is owned and operated by the Josephine County Parks and Recreation Department and serves a variety of purposes -- for public recreation, for irrigation, and for domestic use. Lake Selmac County Park, a 300-acre tract, includes 50 acres on the south shore developed for use: there is a campground, a picnic area, and boat launching facilities. There is also a small private campground at the lake. Recreational use by people from the Grants Pass area is quite heavy. Rainbow trout were first stocked after construction, followed by other species such as crappies, bluegills, largemouth bass, and catfish. Selmac Lake has developed a reputation for excellent bass fishing and it is open all year. The county has further encouraged angling with the construction of piers into the lake to improve bank fishing.</p>
<p>Selmac Lake is rather shallow with a mean depth of only seven feet; nearly three-quarters of the lake is shallower than 10 feet. The concentrations of major ions are about average for reservoirs in the Rogue River basin, although the concentrations of sodium and chloride are relatively high for a water body so far from the ocean. It shares other characteristics similar to coastal lakes: the alkalinity is low and the conductivity somewhat higher. The concentration of phosphorus observed on 9/4/81 was rather high, possibly because of the recycling of phosphorus from the sediment in the extensive shoal area, or perhaps because of human activity. The chlorophyl concentration was not high, however, and water transparency moderate (Secchi disk depth = 7.9 feet; 2.4 meters), these factors indicate mesotrophic conditions.</p>

"Rock Creek Reservoir","254","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Rock Creek Reservoir is an irrigation impoundment in south Central Oregon built and maintained by local interests for irrigation of agricultural land in the Catlow Valley. However, the reservoir is open to the public and receives some attention from fishermen; white crappie and rainbow trout are taken, but reportedly do not produce particularly well. Recreation pressure is not very heavy, and there are no overnight camping facilities at the reservoir. The surrounding landscape is an arid region, most of it administered by the Bureau of Land Management and used for grazing. The upper portion of the drainage basin is within the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge. Rock Creek is the major stream in the basin and there are some other intermittent streams that enter the reservoir.</p>
<p>Rock Creek Reservoir is not deep (maximum depth 35 feet) and it is exposed to the wind. Bottom sediment is frequently resuspended by wave action making the water turbid and greatly limiting transparency. Much of the reservoir is less than ten feet deep, particularly in the southern and eastern arms. Concentrations of ions in the reservoir are well above average for Oregon lakes, but typical of shallow reservoirs east of the Cascades. The concentration of phosphorus is very high and, together with the limited water transparency, identifies the reservoir as eutrophic. Macrophytes grow in the shallow areas and summer blooms of blue-green algae are common.</p>

"Balm Creek Reservoir","153","<p>
<p>(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Balm Creek Reservoir is a small irrigation impoundment, formed by the damming of Balm Creek in about 1930. Balm Creek is a tributary of the Powder River. The small drainage basin is almost entirely forested land within the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. Shoreline ownership is about one-half federal and one-half private. When full, the reservoir covers a surface area of about 112 acres with a maximum depth of 60 feet. According to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, there are plans by a local irrigation district to enlarge the reservoir to a surface area at full pool of 256 acres and a minimum pool of about 70 acres. The Forest Service estimates that annual recreation visitor-days will then increase to about 15,000. There would then be a need to develop facilities for camping and picnicking; there are no such facilities at present. However, the reservoir does offer some good angling for rainbow trout and is fairly popular despite its relative isolation. Fishing is generally good until mid-summer when the water level drops because of withdrawals for irrigation downstream. Boats can be used and trolling is a popular method for anglers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reservoir site was not completely logged off before the dam was built so there are snags in the shallow areas around the perimeter; these snags contribute organic matter and woody debris to the water. The reservoir is protected from the wind and the water column develops a pronounced thermal stratification in the summer. The water surface is fairly warm and there is some swimming near an unofficial campground at the northeastern end of the reservoir. Oxygen is frequently depleted in the hypolimnion, reflecting the oxidation of organic material in the water. The concentration of phosphorus is moderate and supports occasional blooms of phytoplankton, including blue-green algae. Water transparency is limited (7.9 feet; 2.4 meters) because of the phytoplankton growth. Balm Creek Reservoir is classified at the lower end of eutrophy.&nbsp;</p>

"Malheur Reservoir","231","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Malheur Reservoir (also known as Willow Creek Reservoir) is an irrigation and flood control project located on Willow Creek in northeastern Oregon. It was built in the late 1930s by the Orchard Irrigation District and provides water for the irrigation of about 2300 acres of agricultural land downstream on Willow Creek. Inflow to the reservoir is controlled by the natural climatic regime and by irrigation demand along Willow Creek upstream. The Willow Creek drainage basin above the reservoir is a semi-arid rangeland. Most of it is privately owned with scattered pieces of federal land administered by the Bureau of Land Management. About 80 percent of the shoreline of the reservoir is privately owned.</p>
<p>Recreational use of the reservoir is relatively light. There is some water-skiing, but most visitors are fishermen. In 1963 the reservoir, along with most of the Malheur River system, was treated for rough fish. It was then restocked with rainbow trout and angling has been relatively good since that time, although an over abundance of rough fish has been reported by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in recent years. There are two boat ramps available for use, one of them paved, and sanitary facilities built by a sportsman's club. However, there are no facilities for overnight camping.</p>
<p>The bathymetric data presented here represent the reservoir at full pool, a volume of nearly 49,000 acre feet and a surface area of about 1300 acres. However, for several years storage has been limited to 20,000 acre-feet, at a water surface elevation of about 20 feet below full pool, due to instability of the dam. For much of the year, the water level is even lower because of withdrawals for irrigation. Water quality is typical of eastern Oregon reservoirs in a semi-arid basin. There are extremely high concentrations of major ions (conductivity 447 umhos/cm and total phosphorus 0.184 mg/1), probably derived from non-point sources within the drainage basin. The phosphorus supports abundant phytoplankton growth; the phytoplankton, in turn, decrease the water transparency and also reduce the dissolved oxygen concentration in the bottom waters. In sum, Malheur Reservoir is naturally eutrophic.</p>

"Devils Lake (184)","184","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Devils Lake, a small lake in the Central Oregon Cascades, lies on the south side of the Cascade Lakes Highway about a mile west of Sparks Lake. Observers are impressed immediately with the brilliant turquoise color of the shallow lake and the clean sandy bottom. In this sense the name of the lake is a misnomer. However, is was probably applied because of the intense volcanic activity that has occurred in this region of the Cascades in recent geologic times. The lake was obviously formed by the impoundment of water by a lava flow which lies as a mass of jumbled volcanic rock at its east end. Inflow is from small surface streams, Hell Creek from the north and Tyee Creek on the west, as well as from a series of small springs which discharge from the steep southwest slope of Devil Hill.</p>
<p>Devils Lake is a delightful place to visit, is very scenic, and easily accessible. A good Forest Service campground on the west end of the lake provides several isolated sites for visitors. Fishing can be successful at times although the lake is not very productive and the fish are not very large; rainbow trout and eastern brook trout are both found. No motorboats are allowed on the water. Several popular hiking trails begin in the area of Devils Lake. One trail goes up Hell Creek to Moraine Lake, a favorite base camp for groups climbing South Sister. Another trail originates west of Devils Lake near Tyee Creek, and heads westward to Wickiup Plains and Rock Mesa.</p>
<p>This lake is a shallow with an average depth of just over three feet. The mineral content of the water is very low, characteristic of Cascade lakes. However, the concentration of phosphorus is fairly high, comparable to nearby Lava and Little Lava Lakes. The concentration of chlorophyl is low, and the water is sufficiently transparent so that the bottom of the lake is visible everywhere. The available data indicate that the lake is oligotrophic in spite of a fairly high phosphorus content</p>

"Foster Lake","199","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Foster Lake is one of 13 multi-purpose reservoirs in the Willamette Valley built and operated by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. Construction began on Foster Dam and on Green Peter Dam, six miles upstream, in 1961 and was completed in 1968. Foster Dam is immediately below the confluence of the Middle Santiam and South Santiam Rivers, and impounds waters from both. The dam and lake are named for the nearby town of Foster, in turn named for G. P. Foster, who operated a grist mill nearby early in this century.</p>
<p>This wide reservoir is used to reregulate, or ""smooth out"", flows from Green Peter Reservoir as well as to provide storage for flood control, irrigation, and power production. The high visibility of Foster Lake, its nearness to urban centers, and the limited number of other recreational facilities nearby combine to make it a popular recreation site. Summer boating pressure can be heavy, and water skiing is a favorite sport. Rainbow trout are annually stocked, and angling has been good, with some fair-sized fish taken each year. A paved road leads around the lake to several Linn County parks and boat ramps, and a campground is maintained on the eastern shore.</p>
<p>Foster Lake is set in the transition zone between the rolling low hills of the Willamette Valley and the rugged slopes of the Western Cascades. Two narrow arms of the impoundment reach eastward into the steep canyons of the primary inflowing streams. The project lies on the lower edge of the western hemlock vegetation zone, but a history of logging in the drainage basin has altered the dominant species to Douglas fir. Agriculture, roads, and urban land uses have further changed the natural setting around the lake. Although the Corps administers the shoreline, most of the lower drainage basin and land surrounding the lake is privately owned.</p>
<p>Water level is lowered each fall beginning at the end of September for flood control purposes, reaching minimum level by mid-November. The reservoir is refilled each year beginning in February and reaching full pool in mid-May. The surface level fluctuates daily by two feet or less as power demand requires. Power generation at Foster Dam is primarily for base load, and water level fluctuations result from the intermittent discharge from Green Peter Reservoir (upstream) associated with peak power demands. There are some shoreline areas where bank erosion produces local turbidity, as is commonly observed in recently constructed reservoirs. In time, these areas will stabilize and further erosion will diminish. In the winter, there is also significant turbidity during periods of heavy runoff. The chemistry of the water in Foster Lake is typical of Willamette Valley reservoirs. Major ions are present in low concentration and the alkalinity and conductivity are low. The lake develops a distinct temperature stratification in the summer. As in several other reservoirs, surface water temperatures are high enough to interfere with the trout survival in summer. However, a fishery based on planted trout has been successful. Some oxygen depletion of the bottom water occurs, which may also interfere with fish survival. Water transparency is good in the summer, and chlorophyl and phosphorus are rather low, indicating mesotrophic conditions (but close to oligotrophic).</p>

"Delintment Lake","182","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Delintment Lake is a small artificial lake located on Delintment Creek, a tributary to Silver Creek in the northwest part of the Malheur Lake Drainage Basin. The site of the lake was originally beaver ponds surrounded by an open pine forest. It was improved by the Forest Service in 1940 to create a 35 acre lake, 12 feet deep, to be used for recreation. In 1953 it was further improved and enlarged to its present size by the cooperative effort of local interest groups. Surface runoff into the lake is intermittent, and from an area of about 1.2 square miles; on occasion water is diverted into the lake from a nearby stream. For the first few years the lake produced a number of large fish, although they were almost all killed off each winter because of the decay of weeds which causes oxygen depletion. Now the lake is restocked each year and usually provides good angling. There are two Forest Service campgrounds on the shoreline and a good boat ramp.</p>
<p>Although it is shallow, Delintment Lake sometimes develops a thermal stratification. The concentration of ions is somewhat above average for the state as a whole, but typical of reservoirs east of the Cascades. However, the lake does have a history of water quality problems. The concentration of phosphorus is high and stimulates the growth of phytoplankton and macrophytes, which now cover most of the muddy bottom. Water transparency is average (8.9 feet; 2.7 m) and chlorophyl concentrations are moderately high. Based upon the concentration of phosphorus and the extensive growth of macrophytes, the lake is classified as eutrophic. Field studies by the Environmental Protection Agency indicated that this small, shallow lake would be a good place to try nutrient inactivation for plankton control. This might reduce the algae, but presumably have little effect on the very thick beds of macrophytes. It has been proposed that the dam be raised to deepen the lake; if so the weeds would probably disappear from deep water areas, while remaining in a fringe in the shallow water along the shore. The principal use of the lake is for fishing, and reduction of weeds in part of the lake would provide more access for the fishermen.</p>

"Applegate Lake","151","<p>
<p>(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Applegate Lake is a Corps of Engineers reservoir in southwestern Oregon just north of the California border. The project was developed in 1980 (construction began in 1976) by damming the mainstream of the Applegate River 46 miles upstream from its confluence with the Rogue. The river and hence the lake derives its name from Lindsay Applegate, a prominent early Oregon pioneer of this region. Applegate Lake is the second large, multipurpose water resource project in the basin, Lost Creek Lake being the other. Both are components of the Rogue River Basin Project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The contributing drainage basin is almost totally within the Rogue River National Forest of Oregon and California, although there are some scattered parcels of private land. The tributaries rise in the Siskiyou Mountains, a rugged area of mostly ancient metamorphic rocks covered with a thick forest. Shoreline topography is relatively steep in most places, although several smaller areas of flatter slopes exist, offering the potential for development and access. Development of recreational sites around the lake by the Corps of Engineers has been minimal. The wilderness setting has been retained as much as possible and a hiking trail follows the shoreline around the lake. A 10 mph speed limit for boats is enforced at the lake. Applegate Lake reaches a maximum depth of 225 feet just behind the dam and has a mean depth of 83 feet. The rise of water behind the dam has flooded parts of several tributaries of the Applegate River giving the reservoir a highly branched, dendritic shape. Consequently, the length of shoreline is extensive. The design of the dam facility allows water to be withdrawn from any of several depths. Therefore, because of temperature stratification in the reservoir, it is possible to cool the river downstream in the summer by selectively discharging deeper water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Water in Applegate Lake has chemical characteristics which are about average for the region and the lake is classified as mesotrophic. The concentrations of magnesium and calcium are above average, due to the weathering of sedimentary rock in the basin. The concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyl are also above average and water transparency is fairly high (15.1 feet; 4.6 meters). There is no evidence of oxygen depletion or algal blooms in the lake, although the pH is somewhat high.&nbsp;</p>

"Fall Creek Lake","193","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Fall Creek Lake, one of 13 multi-purpose water resource projects built and operated by the U. S. Corps of Engineers in the Willamette Valley, is located on a small tributary of the Middle Fork Willamette River in the rolling hill country southeast of Eugene. It became operational in 1966 and exists primarily to control downstream flooding on the Willamette River. As such, the water level fluctuates throughout the year. From spring until late summer the water level is kept high (maximum depth = 161 feet) and the lake is heavily used for recreation. Beginning in late summer and through the winter, the water level is drawn down to as much as 100 feet below full pool to provide storage for flood waters. It is then less satisfactory for recreation because of the extensive mud flats exposed around the shoreline.</p>
<p>The impoundment is shaped by two main arms, the southern arm fed by Winberry Creek and the northern arm by Fall Creek. A dense, coniferous forest blankets the slopes in the upper part of the drainage basin. In the lower reaches, natural vegetation patterns have been altered by logging, grazing, and agricultural practices. Short-term visual scarring may result as public and private forest management agencies harvest timber resources near the lake. There are some farm sites immediately upstream from the lake in the broad, tributary flood plains. The Corps of Engineers manages the shoreline, while Lane County operates two day-use parks with swimming, boating, and picnicking facilities. Sky Camp (Springfield Kiwanis Youth Camp) has been developed on the south shore in cooperation with the Corps and local school districts. Fishing at Fall Creek Lake is primarily for stocked rainbow and native cutthroat trout that drift down from the tributaries. A fish trap is used at the base of the dam to collect migrating Chinook salmon and steelhead which are then transported upstream to complete their spawning cycle.</p>
<p>Water in Fall Creek Lake is generally high quality, chlorophyl and phosphorus concentrations are low, and biological productivity is low. However, there have been serious problems in the past. Hydrogen sulfide developed in the hypolimnion of the newly constructed reservoir during the summers of 1966 and 1967, and caused a significant fish-kill downstream following the late summer draw-down. Eventually the problem resolved itself as preimpoundment accumulations of organic bottom debris decomposed, and gradual disappearance of these materials allowed a continuous improvement in hypolimnetic oxygen content. Blue-green algal blooms are occasionally a problem, reducing the water transparency. Based on a combination of indicators Fall Creek Lake is classified as mesotrophic.</p>

"Diamond Lake","70","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>,&nbsp;Johnson et al. 1985). Diamond Lake, a large and heavily used lake in the southern Oregon Cascades, lies at an elevation of 5183 feet in a scenic glacial valley between Mt. Thielsen and Mt. Bailey. The lake was not named for its shape as is commonly believed, but for John Diamond, the same man for whom Diamond Peak was named. He discovered the lake from the summit of Diamond Peak in 1852. Pleistocene glaciers scoured out the Diamond Lake basin, creating a broad valley which was blocked about one million years ago by lava flowing from the slopes of Mt. Thielsen. As the glaciers retreated some 10,000 years ago, meltwater filled the shallow valley behind the lava barrier, thereby creating Diamond Lake. Its morphology is similar to that of other ice-scoured lakes in Oregon; that is, an elliptical form with one end shallower than the other. The lake bottom slopes gradually and uniformly to the deepest point (53 feet) north of center. Other lakes in this survey which exhibit similar morphological characteristics include Suttle, Cultus, Odell, and Crescent Lakes in the Cascades, and Wallowa Lake in northeast Oregon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diamond Lake and its drainage basin are entirely within the Umpqua National Forest. The topography and geology of the area is dominated by its volcanic history. The drainage basin is flanked by the High Cascade volcanoes, Mt. Thielsen (9183 feet) and Mt. Bailey (8363 feet). Tiber Crater (7402 feet) marks the southern point of the drainage basin. Soils are porous and well-drained and include glacial debris as well as pumice and ash from the eruption of Mt. Mazama. The bedrock is basaltic, the remnant of lava flows from Mts. Bailey and Thielsen. A coniferous forest covers the landscape and is composed primarily of lodgepole pine, mountain hemlock, and species of fir. Understory vegetation includes huckleberry, grasses, sedges, and manzanita. At the south end of the lake is a large marsh grading into shallow water area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The major inlet streams to Diamond Lake are Silent Creek from the southwest and Short Creek from the southeast. Other tributaries are primarily intermittent and contribute significant flow only from snowmelt. Surface outflow is continuous into Lake Creek, a tributary of the North Umpqua River, and the rate of outflow is regulated by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. Flashboards are generally installed in Lake Creek after spring runoff to maintain the lake level during summer, and then are removed in fall. Although the lake is relatively shallow for its size, the hydrologic retention time is quite long, averaging 1.6 years, because of the comparatively small size of the contributing drainage basin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diamond Lake receives a great amount of recreational use for swimming, fishing, boating, and camping. Winter activities, such as snowmobiling on ice, are also very common. On the shoreline are two private lodges, over 100 seasonal dwellings, three Forest Service campgrounds, and two picnic areas to accommodate visitors. A Forest Service road encircles the lake, providing access at all points. Recreation has increased steadily during the past several decades; in 1923, the lake had 30,000 visitor-days; this increased to 104,000 between 1956-1963, and to 307,000 visitor-days in 1965, and finally in 1977 the lake received about 670,000 visitor-days (Lauer et al 1979). Diamond Lake has a well-established reputation for its large rainbow trout, although this was not always the case. For several years prior to 1954 the fishery had been declining; in that year the lake was treated for an abundance of trash fish. Following treatment it was stocked with Kamloops rainbows, a Canadian strain that provided spectacular fishing for several years. However, the Kamloops fishery eventually proved to be unsatisfactory because the fish did not attain the desired size and were difficult to catch. About 1970 the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife began stocking high grade strains of local rainbow trout. Since then excellent catches have been made with all methods of angling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diamond Lake develops thermal stratification during the summer, although surface temperatures remain cool and the onset of stratification comes rather late in the season because of the high elevation. The lake is ice-covered in the winter and develops a reverse stratification under the ice. Oxygen is depleted below 30 feet depth (10 meters) during both summer and winter stratification. The concentrations of major ions in the lake are somewhat above average for alpine lakes, but typical for Cascade Mountain lakes surrounded by pumice soils. Conductivity (29 umhos/cm) and alkalinity (15 mg/1) are also moderate. During summer, surface pH sometimes exceeds 9 because of the growth of planktonic algae. The concentration of phosphorus in the lake varies substantially from year to year and season to season, but on the average is high enough to cause the lake to be moderately eutrophic.</p>
<p>During the 1920s a sewage collection system was constructed around Diamond Lake to prevent nutrients from human wastes from reaching the water. In 1979 the Environmental Protection Agency completed a thorough study of the impact of this waste-water interception program. The purpose of the study was to define the nutrient budget and describe the benthic macroinvertebrate population (Lauer et al 1979). Conclusions were as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Diamond Lake is mesotrophic to eutrophic as a result of natural nutrient loading from the tributaries, groundwater and bottom sediments. Silent Creek supplies over half the surface runoff to the lake, and Short Creek supplies about 20 percent of the total. The average concentration of phosphorus in these two streams is more than 0.050 mg/1, or enough to support eutrophic conditions in the lake. Inflow of groundwater is thought to contribute approximately 10 percent of the phosphorus entering the lake. In addition, the sediment in the lake is rich in nutrients; these are mobilized by the rooted macrophytes that cover as much as 50 percent of the bottom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The nutrient contribution from cultural activites in the drainage basin is, at present, relatively insignificant compared to natural sources. Heavy use for water-based recreation undoubtedly contributes additional nutrients to the lake. In particular, the common use of canned corn, processed cheese, canned cat food, and other food items such as fish bait or ""chum"" contributes additional nutrients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. During the period of investigation no change was found in the trophic status of the lake that could be attributed to the wastewater diversion system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. The trophic status of Diamond Lake is appropriate in satisfying present recreational demands..Because of the natural loading of phosphorus, algal blooms frequently develop in the lake. Species commonly observed include eutrophic diatoms and a nitrogen fixing bluegreen alga (Anabaena circinalis). The phytoplankton sample of 8/22/82 had a total density lower than in previous studies on Diamond Lake, but the species present were .similar. It may be that this sample is atypical of the average phytoplankton densities. The high growth rates of planktonic algae support a diverse and productive food chain, thus explaining the highly successful development of the trout fishery. In sum, all trophic indicators suggest an eutrophic classification for Diamond Lake.&nbsp;</p>

"North Fork Reservoir","242","<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985)  North Fork Reservoir is the largest of several impoundments operated by the Portland General Electric Company on the Clackamas River. It was formed by construction of a 207-foot high, concrete arch dam in 1958 about a mile below the junction of the North Fork Clackamas River with the main stem, and 29 miles upstream from the confluence with the Willamette River. The project produces power on a peaking schedule, and water level in the reservoir fluctuates about four feet daily. Storage capacity is close to 19,000 acre-feet at full pool, large enough to insure continuous turbine operation not only at its own powerhouse, but for those at Faraday and River Mill powerhouses downstream. Nearly two million acre-feet of water flow through the Clackamas River in an average year, which means that the retention time in the reservoir is very small.
The narrow, deep reservoir stretches four miles into the western slope of the Cascades. It is an area of rugged topography, composed of older volcanic flows deeply cut by tributary streams. Coniferous forests cover the landscape in the 644 square mile drainage basin. This is mostly within the Mt. Hood National Forest, although the reservoir itself is outside of the national forest. Much of the shoreline is in private ownership, but is undeveloped. North Fork Reservoir is close to the Portland metropolitan area and receives heavy use for water-based recreation. It is very popular for boating, water-skiing, and fishing. It is not very productive for native fish but is frequently stocked with rainbow trout. Other species have entered from the river upstream and are caught at times. Boat launching areas are provided and a 16-acre park, Promontory Park, is operated by Portland General Electric. There is also a private concession with fishing and boating supplies at the upper end of the lake. Several forest service camps are located upstream. A 10-mile-per-hour speed limit is enforced on the upper two miles of the reservoir, and keeps speed boats from interfering with angling in the resort and park area.
Water chemistry in North Fork Reservoir (concentrations of major ions, alkalinity, and conductivity) is typical of streams draining the west slope of the Cascades. The concentrations of chlorophyl and phosphorus are moderate, as is water transparency (Secchi disk depth = 14.4 feet; 4.4 meters), and indicate mesotrophic conditions. Water temperatures remain quite cool through the summer and the water column is saturated with oxygen. Phytoplankton densities are fairly low; the greenish cast to the water results from very fine particulate matter in the runoff rather than from biological growth.</p>","17090011005288","","125591550","01154442","North Fork Reservoir","6"

"Wallowa Lake","140","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Wallowa Lake, lying at the foot of The Wallowa Mountains in a spectacular alpine setting, is one of northeastern Oregon's finest scenic and recreational resources. Behind the lake, a precipitous mountain front rises dramatically to the summit of Chief Joseph Mountain, nearly a mile higher than the lake. The glacial origin of the lake is evidenced by the spectacular morainal deposits which enclose it; and by the glaciated valleys that lie above it in the Wallowa Mountains. It is one of the finest examples of a morainal lake anywhere in the United States. Formation of the lake was due to the combined result of the damming of the Wallowa River by the two high lateral moraines, one on each side, and a lower terminal moraine at the north end. These lateral moraines are remarkable topographic features: the crests extend 900 feet above the lake, and their bases are beneath the water line. At the north end, morainal heights decrease gradually toward convergence with the level of the outwash plain. The deposits of at least four periods of glaciation make up these composite moraines (Crandell 1967). The morphometric characteristics of lakes are determined by the mode of origin. It is approximately three and one-half miles in length from north to south and three-fourths of a mile wide, and has a distinct curve to the northwest in its lower portion. Maximum depth of the lake is 299 feet and, as noted on the bathymetric map, it is situated in a U-shaped basin typical of a glacial valley. The littoral zone, or shoal area, is only 3 percent of the lake area.</p>
<p>Wallowa Lake lies at an elevation of 4383 feet above sea level. It is fed by the Wallowa River which is the result of the union of two streams less than a mile above the lake. West Fork, the larger of the two, heads ten miles upstream in a broad expanse of cirques, ridges, and peaks between altitudes of 8000 and 10,000 feet. East Fork originates five miles upstream in a high cirque that encloses Aneroid Lake. Because of the steep longitudinal gradient of these streams, the Wallowa River flows turbulently at high velocities and is thus able to transport a substantial load of coarse sediments. Deposition then occurs at the south end of the lake where the river enters, forming a prominent alluvial delta which continues to build lakeward and fill the basin (Larson 1981). The abrupt northwest-trending front of the Wallowa Mountains is bordered by a plain that is drained by the Wallowa River after leaving the lake. Forty-five miles downstream, the river joins the Grande Ronde River, a tributary of the Snake River.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although it is a natural lake, Wallowa Lake has been regulated to some degree since 1884 when a rough dam was built across the outlet to service a nearby shingle mill. In 1890, a heavier dam was constructed and an irrigation ditch laid out. Subsequent enlargements of the dam have increased the total capacity of the lake to over 240,000 acre feet. Water from the lake now irrigates a large amount of acreage in the Wallowa Valley and is an integral part of the agricultural economy. One unfortunate result of damming the lake was to terminate a natural run of sockeye salmon. Until about 1890, Wallowa Lake was one of the few non-coastal lakes in the Pacific Northwest used for spawning by migratory salmonoids. Construction of a larger dam for power generation in 1916 terminated the fish runs permanently. As a consequence, some fish, which came to be known as kokanee salmon, remained in the lake as a naturally reproducing, landlocked population (Bartlett 1975).</p>
<p>Wallowa Lake is best known as a recreational area. In addition to the native fish, rainbow trout, mackinaw, and Dolly Varden have been stocked and the lake offers excellent fishing. A good highway skirts the eastern shoreline and provides access to a large state park at the south end. Those wishing to explore the back country of the Wallowa Mountains, the Eagle Cap Wilderness, must proceed on any one of a number of scenic trails. Recreational use at the lake has increased dramatically in the last two or three decades and so has the number of lakeside residences, from a scattered few in the 1940s to over 300. Shoreline ownership is about 56 percent private land, while the remainder is state park.</p>
<p>During the summer, the lake develops a distinct thermal stratification. The surface layer remains cool, but is warm enough for swimming and water-skiing, especially at the southwestern end of the lake where there is a small sandy beach. The water below abut 130 feet (40 meters) is perennially cold, near 39 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius). Winters in northeast Oregon are quite cold and the lake frequently freezes over; sometimes the entire surface is frozen. Thus, the annual cycle of temperature in the lake is a classic illustration of a dimictic lake, with two periods of mixing, one in the spring, the second in the fall. The concentrations of major ions in Wallowa Lake are moderate, but somewhat unusual because of the relatively highconcentrations of sulfate and calcium. The pH is also above average for a lake which in most respects appears to be oligotrophic. It is likely that the calcium, sulfate, and bicarbonate are largely derived from the weathering of glacial flour and other fine particulates brought into the lake by the Wallowa River. The lake is saturated with oxygen at all depths.The bottom sediment is relatively coarse. The banks are very steep and in many places strewn with large boulders left behind by the retreating glacier. Consequently the annual raising and lowering of the lake level for irrigation causes no noticeable bank erosion. There is also no suitable substrate for macrophytes and they are nearly absent from the lake. The lack of any shallow sediment and the great average depth also contribute to the oligotrophic character of the lake. The populations of phytoplankton are low to moderate. The dominant species (<em>Dinobryon divergens</em>) indicates oligotrophic to mesotrophic conditions. Total phosphorus is usually low, and water transparency is moderate to excellent. Turbidity is very low (less than 1 JTU) and suspended solids are less than 2 mg/L (Larson 1981). The general character of Wallowa Lake is distinctly oligotrophic, although primary productivity by phytoplankton may be somewhat more than expected in a very oligotrophic lake.&nbsp;</p>

"Unity Reservoir","282","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Unity Reservoir is the major component of the Burnt River Project, an irrigation complex built by the Bureau of Reclamation and operated by the local Burnt River Irrigation District. Unity Dam, completed in January 1939, impounds the flow of Burnt River and its tributaries and provides storage for nearly 26,000 acre-feet of water. Through its distribution system, the Project supplies supplemental water for the irrigation of about 16,000 acres in Baker County, land which formerly depended on the natural flow of the Burnt River. The drainage basin is mostly federal forest land within the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. However, the lower reaches consist of more private land and about 80 percent of the shoreline of the reservoir is privately owned.</p>
<p>Although it was built for irrigation storage, Unity Reservoir is an important recreation site and receives over 30,000 visitor-use days per year. Rainbow trout are stocked and provide good angling. Coho salmon have also been stocked in past years, but with little success as they tend to migrate out of the reservoir. There is a nice state park on the shore which includes a picnic area, a boat ramp, and a small campground. At full pool, the maximum depth of the reservoir is about 50 feet; but for much of the year, especially in late summer and fall, it is much shallower because of irrigation withdrawals, and recreation activity is then limited.</p>
<p>The concentrations of major ions in the water are fairly high, characteristic of surface water in this semiarid region; calcium and sulfate concentrations are particularly high. Fine sediment on the bottom and sides of the reservoir is easily brought into suspension by wave action. Because of this fine inorganic sediment and the frequent changes in surface level, the reservoir is often turbid, noticeably reducing water transparency. During summer there is an intense bloom of <em>Aphanizomenon</em>, a blue-green alga, which further reduces transparency. The bloom is maintained by the high concentration of phosphorus, derived from the aforementioned sediment and from drainage basin runoff. The concentration of chlorophyl, also derived from the phytoplankton bloom, is high. The growth of <em>Aphanizomenon</em> also drives up the pH which is among the highest observed in the state. There is no evidence of nutrient enrichment from artificial sources; Unity Reservoir is naturally very eutrophic.</p>

"Blue River Lake","157","<p>
<p>(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Blue River Lake is a long, narrow, winding flood control reservoir formed in 1968 by damming the Blue River 1.8 miles above its confluence with the McKenzie River. It was built here by the Corps of Engineers after strong opposition developed toward the construction of a dam on the mainstem of the McKenzie. There are actually two rockfill dams, Blue River Dam and Saddle Dam, that impound the waters of Blue River and several of its tributaries. The lake was named for Blue River which was named for its remarkable color. It lies in a beautiful setting nestled among the rugged slopes of the Western Cascades. Rough rock pinnacles and outcroppings are common throughout the area. Around the turn of the century gold was traced to the Gold Hill area immediately northwest of Blue River Lake on Quartz Creek and mining boomed for ten years until the supply was exhausted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drainage basin of Blue River Lake is covered with a western hemlock and Douglas fir forest and is almost entirely within the Willamette National Forest. Some of the land adjacent to the lake is in private ownership and commercial timber has been harvested from much of it. The Corps of Engineers also administers a large part of the shoreline. Steep shoreline slopes restrict the amount of flat land around the lake, thereby limiting the potential for public access and recreation. The Forest Service maintains one campground and an unpaved boat ramp at the north end of the lake. Late summer use is frequently limited by reservoir draw-down. The lake is stocked annually with cutthroat trout and also has native cutthroat trout and coho salmon. In addition to fishing the lake is popular for swimming and water skiing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Water transparency in Blue River Lake is good (17.1 feet; 5.2 meters), although high values of suspended solids have been reported by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. This has apparently caused a minor problem in fish production. Major ion concentrations are average for Willamette Valley reservoirs. Although water transparency is very high, the concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyl suggest moderate productivity and mesotrophic conditions. Blue-green algae have been observed in the lake which suggests higher trophic conditions than indicated by other data. However, because there is no evidence of oxygen depletion, Blue River Lake is classified as mesotrophic.&nbsp;</p>

"Odell Lake","106","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Odell Lake, 3582 acres in surface area, is one of the largest lakes in the Oregon Cascades. It lies near the summit of the range and adjacent to Oregon Highway 58. The lake basin is generally considered to be a glacial trough formed during the Pleistocene Epoch when a layer of ice hundreds of feet thick covered the Cascades at high elevations. The lake probably filled 10,000 to 12,000 years ago behind a terminal moraine which impounded the headwaters of Odell Creek. An important subsequent event in the history of the lake was the eruption of Mt. Mazama 6600 years ago. Volcanic ash was carried northward where it showered onto the loamy soils and andesite lava of the basin. A mantle of this permeable, volcanic residue now covers the drainage basin and allows for rapid percolation of water. Thus, there is a considerable contribution of groundwater into Odell Lake, particularly along the south shoreline. One large surface stream, Trapper Creek, feeds the lake, and there are numerous short, smaller streams entering from the north. Odell Creek, the major outlet, flows eastward for 13 miles where it discharges into Davis Lake. The drainage basin of Odell Lake is 37.4 square miles and extends to the Cascade Divide. The vegetation cover is typical of this elevation in the Cascades. There are a number of true firs, including Pacific silver fir, Shasta red fir, subalpine fir, and white fir. Engelmann spruce, western and mountain hemlock, Douglas fir, ponderosa, lodgepole, and white pines also thrive in this region. A luxuriant growth of bushes such as huckleberries also adds to the diversity of species in the area.</p>
<p>Historic Odell Lake was named for William Holman Odell, a pioneer who came to Oregon from Indiana in 1852. He was involved with the surveying of a military wagon road which ran from Eugene to southern Idaho and, in 1871, he was appointed surveyor general for Oregon. The first access road to Odell Lake was built in 1910, and a resort lodge was built in 1927; but recreational use on the lake was low until the construction of Highway 58 in 1940. By the mid-1950s the lake had become a popular recreational site and use has increased steadily since. In 1981, the lake received 133,000 visitor days. Many summer homes, two private resorts, a marina, and five Forest Service campgrounds are on the shoreline. The primary activity is fishing for kokanee, but the lake also has mackinaw and rainbow trout; in 1974 a mackinaw weighing 35 pounds was taken. Kokanee are naturally spawning, but are also stocked (150,000 annually). Boating, swimming, and camping are other important activities.</p>
<p>The glacial trough in which Odell Lake lies determines its morphometry. It is a deep, elongate lake basin, with steep sides. Only a small percentage (4 percent) of the lake bottom is shoal area (less than 10 feet deep). There is very little growth of macrophytes because of this small amount of shallow water and for lack of suitable substrate; most of the lake shore is rocky. Because of the depth of the lake and its elevation, deep water remains very cold year round (approximately 39 degrees F; 4 degrees C). During the winter, the lake sometimes freezes over. In summer the water column develops a pronounced thermal stratification. The depth of the thermocline varies from 10 to 33 feet (3 to 10 meters), which is generally deeper than in most other lakes in the region. The deep thermocline is a result of the very vigorous mixing by wind. The long axis of the lake lies parallel to the strong winds which blow from west to east through Willamette Pass throughout the summer. The strong surface winds also sometimes generate internal waves (seiches) within the lake, causing the local displacement of the depth of the thermocline.</p>
<p>The phytoplankton in Odell Lake reflect varying ecological conditions. In the spring of 1982, a diatom bloom consisting mostly of <em>Tabellaria fenestrata</em>, with lesser amounts of <em>Asterionella formosa</em>, was observed. Although <em>Tabellaria</em> is considered to be an indicator of oligotrophic conditions, its relatively high density and the presence of the mesotrophic diatom <em>Asterionella</em> are more typical of a higher trophic state. Two summer phytoplankton samples, one collected in August of 1981 and the other in August of 1982, were dissimilar regarding both density and species composition, thus illustrating the variability that can occur between successive years of sampling. In 1981 the phytoplankton density was quite low, with no one particular species dominant, whereas in 1982 the density was higher and was dominated by the blue-green alga <em>Anabaena spiroides</em>. In the fall, there were high densities of <em>Melosira, Asterionella</em>, and <em>Fragilaria</em>.</p>
<p>For the most part, the chemistry of the water in Odell Lake is unexceptional. Major ion concentrations, alkalinity and conductivity are typical for lakes of the region which have porous pumice soils in their drainage basin. During summer, however, surface water pH may exceed 9 because of the photosynthetically induced depletion of free CO and HCO3- by highly productive blooms of phytoplankton. Based upon measures of chlorophyl, phosphorus, and the species composition ofphytoplankton, the lake can be classified broadly as mesotrophic. On the other hand, most measures of water transparency indicate that the lake is oligotrophic; only during algal blooms does the transparency decrease to 16 feet (5 meters) or less. The active growth of phytoplankton is the base of a productive food chain which supports the successful mackinaw and kokanee fishery. Historical data indicate that Odell Lake has been strongly influenced by the input of nutrients associated with the use of the lake for recreation. The earliest data on the lake (Newcomb 1941) suggest that it was then distinctly oligotrophic. However, by the late 1960s the concentration of nutrients had increased substantially, stimulating an increase in the growth of phytoplankton including the initial appearance of blue-green algae (cyanophyta), and a decrease in water transparency; in short, the eutrophication of the lake (Larson 1970d). Odell Lake appears to be particularly susceptible to cultural eutrophication because of the inability of the unusually porous soils in its drainage basin to absorb and hold nutrients. Since the 1960s, the design of most of the sanitary facilities around the lake has been altered so that most of the nutrients are now removed. There has been a corresponding decline in nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton growth and an increase in water transparency, leaving the lake in its present mesotrophic condition.</p>

"Lemolo Number 2 Forebay","219","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Lemolo Lake is the largest reservoir in the North Umpqua Power Development Project, a project which also includes Toketee Lake about 15 miles downstream. The reservoir was created by Pacific Power and Light in 1954 by impounding the headwaters of the North Umpqua River with a 120-foot high rockf ill dam. Lake Creek which drains Diamond Lake higher in the drainage basin is the second major surface inflow. The name Lemolo is taken from scenic Lemolo Falls (168 feet high) located about two miles downstream from the dam. It is a Chinook jargon word meaning wild or untamed. The primary purpose of the project, of course, is power generation for cities in Douglas County and the reservoir is operated accordingly. However, it has also become very popular as a recreation site for water-skiing and swimming from good pumice beaches. Mt. Thielsen forms a picturesque backdrop for the lake which has three Forest Service campgrounds and a private resort to accommodate visitors. Angling for trout is good from spring through fall, although it usually slacks off in midsummer. Some very large brown trout were taken in past years, but this no longer appears to be the case. There is still good fishing for small brown trout.</p>
<p>Lemolo Lake exhibits the dendritic, or branched, shape typical of impounded waters in stream valleys. Two principle arms receive the inflow from Lake Creek and the North Fork of the Umpqua River. Although the lake is rather deep (100 feet) directly behind the dam, most of it is shallower than 40 feet and the mean depth is only 30 feet at full pool.</p>
<p>Major ion concentrations and conductivity are slightly above average for lakes and reservoirs in the Cascades, water transparency is surprisingly low (only 6.5 feet; 2 meters), and chlorophyl and total phosphorus concentrations are distinctly above average for Cascade lakes; this combination of parameters indicates eutrophic conditions. However, the sample upon which this determination was made was taken during algal bloom season. In general, a more appropriate classification is mesotrophic. The pH of the surface water is also rather high (8 to 9.5), presumably because of the active growth of planktonic algae. The generous supply of phosphorus in the water and the relatively shallow mean depth contribute to the growth of the planktonic algae, establishing the aquatic food chain that supports a productive brown trout fishery.</p>

"Clear Lake (169)","169","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Clear Lake was a small natural lake on the southeast slope of Mt. Hood until it was increased in size in the 1950s to serve as a storage impoundment for irrigation in Wasco County. The 44-foot high earthfill dam that impounds the headwaters of Clear Creek is called Wasco Dam and the lake itself is frequently referred to as Wasco Reservoir. It is operated as a component of the Juniper Flat District Improvement Company. Clear Creek is a tributary of the White River, but much of the outflow from the reservoir is diverted into the Clear Creek Irrigation Ditch prior to joining the White River. The drainage basin, entirely within the Mt. Hood National Forest, supports a dense forest of fir and hemlock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to enlargement, Clear Lake offered excellent fly-fishing for brook trout. Fishing is still good for brook trout and also rainbow trout. Trolling and bait fishing are common in addition to the use of flies early and late in the day. However, successful trout fishing is somewhat restricted by the seasonal draw-down to meet downstream water needs. Very low water levels occur in late summer and fall, the time of maximum irrigation needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the maximum depth of Clear Lake is only about 22 feet (approximately 32 feet at full pool) the walls of the basin are steep and much of the rest of the bottom is relatively flat so that the mean depth is 15.6 feet. The shape of the reservoir is branched, characteristic of impounded water bodies. There is no significant growth of macrophytes in the reservoir. Stumps left from logging of the basin are visible in shallow water and are exposed when the water level is lowered in the fall. The water is transparent and the bottom can be seen at all depths. The mineral content of the water is low, as are alkalinity and conductivity. Nutrient concentrations are also low and there is relatively little growth of phytoplankton. Productivity is limited and the reservoir is oligotrophic.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Rock Creek Reservoir is a small irrigation impoundment on the east slope of Mt. Hood just inside the eastern border of the Mt. Hood National Forest. It was developed in the 1940s with construction of a 50-foot high, earthfill dam on Rock Creek. The origin of the name Rock Creek is impossible to establish with certainty. There are at least fifty streams in Oregon with this name, bestowed by early residents with little concern for originality. This Rock Creek seems to have been named by one Joel Palmer who passed through the area in 1845. Surface inflow is from a drainage basin of about 17.5 square miles, a landscape supporting a forest of ponderosa pine. In addition to the inflow of Rock Creek, there is contribution from Wildcat Spring at the southwest end, and water is diverted from Gate Creek into the reservoir. Natural outflow is into Rock Creek, tributary to the White River which it joins about eight miles from the dam. Water is also diverted directly into the Rock Creek Ditch.</p>

"Fern Ridge Lake","78","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Fern Ridge Lake is a large reservoir near Eugene, built by the Corps of Engineers in 1941 by the damming of the Long Tom River. It is operated primarily for recreation in the summer and flood control in the winter, and is also part of a major wildlife management area. Fern Ridge is physically much different than other Corps of Engineers reservoirs in the Willamette Valley. Originally, it was a flat swampy portion of the valley floor, and one long, low dam and supplementary dikes were required to contain the water. At full pool during summer months it covers about 15 square miles, but averages only 11 feet deep; the maximum depth is 33 feet. Major shoreline features include two peninsulas, Perkins and Jeans Peninsulas, and one large island, Gibson Island, which has several small islands around it. Fern Ridge Dam crosses the Long Tom River 23.6 miles above its confluence with the Willamette River. The dam also cuts off the channel of Coyote Creek, although the spillway was only built into the Long Tom River. The reservoir is filled primarily by inflow from the Long Tom River and Coyote Creek, with about 10 percent of the inflow coming from the Amazon Channel Basin and other small drainage basins feeding directly into the lake. A total land area of 275 square miles drains into Fern Ridge Lake. Generally, all streams except the Long Tom River stop flowing by late summer, although some may retain standing water. Water level in the reservoir drops by 1.5 to 3.0 feet over the summer because evaporation, irrigation, and downstream minimum flow releases exceed the inflow. The minimum winter pool elevation (353 feet)</p>
<p>maintained for flood control is 20 feet lower than the conservation/recreation pool (373 feet) maintained in summer and only contains six percent of the maximum volume of water. Winter drawdown leaves extensive mud flats exposed. Stream flows generally pass through the reservoir in less than a week during winter; much of the inflow passes through in the deeply etched historical channels until it reaches the reservoir level. The flats are periodically exposed to waves as the reservoir level raises and lowers.</p>
<p>Fern Ridge Lake is among the most heavily used recreation sites in Oregon and provides for a variety of uses, including swimming, picnicking, all forms of boating, fishing, and assorted other activities. For most activities, users come from the local area in the southern end of the Willamette Valley, although the good, steady winds attract many sailors from farther away. Annual park usage is 1 to 1.5 million recreational user-days. Three public parks (two by the Corps, one by Lane County) have been developed for high density use, while two other public parks (one Corps, one county) are less developed. There is no overnight camping at any of these parks, although, a large private park nearby does include a campground. The fishery does not attract many anglers since non-game fish predominate. However, there are crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass and trout in small numbers. Fishing generally takes place in shallow areas, near shore, and at places where stream channels enter the reservoir. Reservoir elevation affects fishing success. At full pool, many fish hide in the densely vegetated areas that are unfishable; lower levels draw the fish into the open</p>
<p>water. Flood control and most recreational activities are often conflicting in Fern Ridge Lake because even a small drawdown from the recreation pool makes the water inaccessible, except at the dam. The present practice is to begin filling the reservoir in February and complete filling by mid-April. Water level is maintained as high as possible until September. It is then drained by mid-November to the minimum pool level and operated for flood control until February.</p>
<p>Emergent macrophytes in the lake include reed canary grass, (<em>Phalaris arundinacea</em>), bull rush (<em>Scirpus validus</em>), and cattail (<em>Typha latifolia</em>). Reed canary grass has been expanding its coverage and crowding out the other macrophytes in many areas. It is an inferior food and cover plant for waterfowl and efforts are planned to reduce its extent. In a few areas submergent macrophytes predominate; however, reservoir level fluctuations prevent plant establishment in most of the deeper locations. Many other areas of marshland are located adjacent to the shallow water on flat-lying, poorly drained soils where ponds form in response to winter rains. The marshland serves as a critical wave buffer which protects the shoreline from erosion and reduces the force of waves on the shallow bottom. The annual drawdown of the reservoir exposes the bottom to killing winter frosts which few deepwater macrophytes can survive. Thus, two-thirds of the reservoir is essentially devoid of macrophytes even though much of it is shallow enough to support rooted plantsThe wetlands at the south and west sides of the reservoir provide excellent habitat for many kinds of birds. Most of these areas are managed for wildlife use by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife or as natural areas by the Corps. The water level fluctuation in the reservoir, however, makes a less than optimal habitat for nesting waterfowl and migrating shorebirds. A series of dikes and grain fields have been developed on higher Corps property to actively attract waterfowl. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has proposed activities such as providing nesting mounds within the reservoir to improve wildlife habitat. Several birds which are not common in the Willamette Valley reside in the Fern Ridge area, and the area near Royal Avenue is especially popular for bird watching.</p>
<p>Lane Council of Governments investigated the water quality and pollution sources in Fern Ridge Lake from March 1981 to September 1982 under a study funded by the Clean Lakes Program (LCOG 1983). Until this EPA-funded study was done, there had been only limited testing of water quality in the lake, even though it had a history of turbidity problems. In addition, bacteria problems and problems from excessive plant and algal growth were suspected. The study was intended to identify water quality problems and identify measures to restore or improve water quality. Findings are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>1. Inflowing tributaries bring high concentrations of nitrogen (Long Tom River and Amazon Channel), phosphorus (Amazon Channel and Coyote Creek), bacteria and organic material (Coyote Creek and Amazon Channel), contaminants from chemical spills (Amazon Channel), and high levels of turbidity (Long Tom River and Coyote Creek), especially during winter storms. Bacteria counts in the reservoir were found to be low during the summer, giving no indication of a threat to human health. Similarly, most of the nutrients appear to be taken up by rooted wetland plants; thus algal growth is limited by nutrients and reduced transparency due to high turbidity. However, algal species present indicated an enriched lake system.</p>
<p>2. Water quality in the reservoir declines rapidly through the summer as the water level is drawn down. Water is typically clearest in May and June, but by August turbidity has reduced transparency to a very low level. A major component of the summer turbidity appeared to originate from the natural clay bottom and settled silts in the shallow southeast portion of the reservoir near Perkins Peninsula Park. Fine clay particles were found throughout the reservoir and heavier silts and clays were suspended by wind action and other factors such as foraging fish, motorboats, and beach use.</p>
<p>3. In winter, there is a significant increase in suspended sediment, bacteria, and nutrients, due mostly to contributions from Coyote Creek and Amazon Channel.</p>
<p>A final report of the LCOG study states that the lake quality should be improved to protect water contact recreation and warm water fisheries and to achieve water clarity for public safety and aesthetic acceptability during the June through September period. The report evaluates and recommends a series of restoration techniques including beach improvement, rocking banks, restricting water circulation, agriculture best management practices, and reentrainment through the construction of dikes and establishing vegetation on clay deposits. Restoration has been discussed with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers since they are one of the entities responsible for the lake. The LCOG study should be consulted for details, and for recommended enhancement alternatives. In summary, water quality is the result of tributary and ground water contributions, biological activity, sediment content, human use, and physical circulation within the reservoir. The water itself tends to be neutral with low conductance, alkalinity, hardness, and chloride values. Total phosphorus and chlorophyl concentrations indicate that the lake is mesotrophic, the low transparency is due to suspended inorganic particles and is therefore unreliable as a trophic indicator.</p>

"Lake Billy Chinook","44","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Lake Billy Chinook (also known as Round Butte Reservoir) is the uppermost of two Portland General Electric reservoirs on the Deschutes River. It is located about 100 miles above the confluence of the Deschutes with the Columbia River. Round Butte Dam was completed in 1964 by P.G.E. for hydro-electric power generation. It is an earth and rockfill structure 440 feet high, designed to hold 535,000 acre feet of water and to generate 300,000 kw of electric energy. The dam is named for Round Butte, a prominent topographic feature rising directly to the east. The name Billy Chinook is in honor of a Wasco Indian who joined the John C. Fremont expedition in 1843 and eventually accompanied the explorer to Washington D.C. Billy Chinook later became one of the nominal chiefs of the Dalles band of Wascos and in this capacity was a signer of the ""Treaty with the Tribes of Middle Oregon, 1855"".</p>
<p>The lake is a very busy recreation site. A huge state park, Cove Palisades, sits astride the Deschutes River and the Crooked River Arms. Several boat launching ramps, a swimming beach, and camping and picnicking sites are available in the park and all receive very heavy use. Angling is good for a variety of species. Rainbow trout are stocked heavily and are taken in good numbers as are other trout species such as Dolly Vardon and brown trout. Kokanee angling has also become quite successful following a stocking program in the 1970s. Power boating and water skiing are favorite pastimes during the warm summer months.</p>
<p>The large impoundment drains the entire Deschutes River basin above Round Butte Dam, an area of 7380 square miles ranging from semi-arid rangeland to the forested crest of the Cascades. The lake itself consists essentially of three long, narrow arms where water behind the dam backs up into the Metolius, Deschutes, and Crooked Rivers. The Metolius arm is 12 miles long and contributes 40 percent of the inflow; the Crooked River arm is six miles long and also contributes 40 percent of the inflow; the Deschutes arm is 8.5 miles long and provides the other 20 percent of the inflow. Much of the limnological character of the lake depends upon the water quality characteristics of each river. In general, the Metolius river which drains forested terrain to the west, supplies water which is cooler, lower in dissolved minerals, and much less turbid. The Crooked River drains an area with extensive pasture and agriculture land. Water from this drainage basin contains a higher concentration of dissolved minerals, is warmer in the summer, and frequently carries a substantial load of silt. The Deschutes River water is generally intermediate in character and receives the greatest influence from human development. Each major inlet contributes relatively high concentrations of major ions to the lake. Much of the drainage basins of the Crooked and Deschutes Rivers are in semi-arid climates where evaporation concentrates the major ions, and the main source of Metolius River water is from ground water which contains high concentrations of major ions. Similarly, phosphorus concentrations are high in the inlets (including the Metolius) and throughout the entire lake.</p>
<p>Water transparencies in Lake Billy Chinook are influenced primarily by the amount of sediment entering the lake from the three rivers, and less so by the densities of phytoplankton. The lowest transparency value in this survey of 3.6 feet (1.1 meters) was recorded in the Crooked River arm, followed by 6.6 feet (2.0 meters) near the dam, 8.5 feet (2.6 meters) in the Deschutes arm, and 19.7 feet (6.0 meters) in the Metolius arm. In contrast, the highest value recorded by Mullarkey (1967) was 40 feet (12.2 meters) in the Metolius arm; his lowest was 0.3 feet (0.1 meters) in the Crooked River arm. Seasonally, water transparency was lowest in the spring in the 1982 survey: a value of 6.6 feet (2.0 meters) was noted at the sample site behind the dam on 5/21/82, in comparison to 14.8 feet (4.5 meters) in summer, and 13 feet (4.0 meters) in autumn. Dissolved oxygen in the reservoir ranges from 0 to super saturated (maximum observed D.O. was 16 ppm). The lowest dissolved oxygen occurs in the silt laden hypolimnion of the Crooked River arm. In the epilimnion, and in the Metolius arm in general, dissolved oxygen remains at 6ppm or higher, more than adequate for salmonid fish. The lake stratified in the summer of 1982, with a thermocline at about 23 feet (7 meters). The surface water temperature reached 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius) at this time, favoring water skiing and swimming activities. During stratification, only a moderate depletion of hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen occurred.</p>
<p>The phytoplankton species clearly indicate eutrophic conditions; however, their densities are lower than might be predicted from the high nutrient concentrations and warm water temperatures. The predominant algal species (near the dam) during the spring were eutrophic diatoms(<em>Stephanodiscus, Asterionella, Fragilaria</em>) and the flagellate <em>Cryptomonas</em>. During summer, a light bloom of <em>Aphanizomenon</em> was visibly present, but was neither objectionable nor a deterrent to water contact sports. Phytoplankton samples were collected from sites near each major inlet (within the reservoir) in May 1982. Each sample, although similar in that each consisted of periphytic algae (algae growing ""attached"" to a substrate), contained a different assemblage of algal species. The algae near the dam were different from the algae at each inlet, and contained true planktonic species. Macrophytes are scarce in Lake Billy Chinook due to the very steep littoral areas and the rocky substrate. Overall, the trophic state of this lake is eutrophic, but at the lower end of the spectrum. Because of the basin morphometry (steep shores and large volume), and because the phosphorus concentration is already quite high, it is unlikely that future increases in recreational activities would adversely affect the water quality.</p>

"Upper Cow Lake","283","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Upper Cow Lake is one of two quite large lakes located in the Jordan Craters area of southeast Oregon. They were formed when the Cow Creek Valley was choked by a number of geologically recent lava flows. The flows issued from the Jordan Craters which are aligned in a north-south direction a little to the west of Cow Creek. One result of this mode of origin is that the lakes extend into lateral valleys behind the lava dam; hence they have very irregular shorelines. During high water stages water overflows across the basalt to supply a number of other lakes in the lava terrain to the southwest. Inflow to the lakes is from a number of intermittent streams and from seepage through the volcanic terrain. There is a 17-foot difference in water surface elevation between the two lakes when they are full, but during summer months water levels drop considerably. Both are very shallow and are connected by a narrow channel called The Narrows.</p>
<p>Control structures have been constructed at the outlets of both Upper and Lower Cow Lakes and the waters are used for irrigation downstream in the summer. The drainage basin above the lakes is a landscape of sparse vegetation, used mainly for cattle grazing. Much of the area is under the administration of the Bureau of Land Management, interspersed with privately owned lands. Upper Cow Lake is the only one to receive attention from fishermen. It was treated chemically in 1963 and restocked with rainbow trout. Rough fish have returned and inhibit fishing somewhat; but good trout are still taken. The Bureau of Land Management has provided a camp with trailer sites, stores, and supplies, and a boat launch.</p>
<p>Both Upper and Lower Cow Lakes are similar in terms of water quality; both are hypereutrophic. Major ion and phosphorus concentrations are among the highest of any lakes in this survey, whereas transparency values are among the lowest. These lakes have several problems due to their location in an arid, windblown region, and because of their shallow depths. Phytoplankton are abundant (chlorophyl 5.6 ug/l in each lake) as are macrophytes; suspended sediment concentrations are very high; water temperatures are warm; dissolved oxygen is low; and trash fish are overpopulated.</p>

"Sutton Lake","126","<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"">
</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.2em;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><span style=""line-height: 19px;"">
<p style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Sutton Lake on the central Oregon coast is one of several lakes concentrated in an eight mile stretch of dunal topography north of Florence and the Siuslaw River. It is part of the same ancient stream system that includes Mercer Lake directly to the east. Both lakes were formed as a result of coastal submergence following the Pleistocene Epoch, a period in which the lower reaches of coastal steams were inundated by rising sea level. Subsequently, the mouth of this system was buried by advancing sand dunes and by the infilling of sediments from streams descending from the Coast Range. Sutton and Mercer Lakes both represent ponded portions of the headwaters of these streams with water surfaces above present sea level and the bottom of the lake basins below sea level; at Sutton Lake the bottom is approximately three feet below sea level (Cooper 1958).</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Sutton Lake is, in fact, two distinct basins of about equal size, connected by a 200-foot long narrow channel which is about four to five feet deep. Surface inflow to the northeast (upper) basin is from Rock Creek and other small surface streams. Mercer Creek enters the southwest (lower) basin through Sutton Lake Marsh, a dense willow and peat bog which separates the two water bodies. The marsh is a valuable natural habitat, of substantial value to fur bearers and waterfowl. Privately owned, it has been classified by the Nature Conservancy as a ""significant natural area"" and its protection is encouraged. Fairly extensive marshes, in fact, exist around much of the lake. The outflow from Sutton Lake is into Sutton Creek, which enters the ocean two miles distant. The eastern shore of the northeast basin abuts the steep slopes of the Coast Range. The west side is partially flanked by dunes, separated from larger dune forms to the west by U. S. Highway 101.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Fishing is good in the highly productive lake; there are both rainbow and cutthroat trout. Native cutthroats have made up most of the catch in past years, but the lake is stocked fairly heavily with hatchery rainbow trout. There are also a few bass, perch, and bluegill. A Forest Service Campground and a good day use facility with a boat ramp and dock are located near the outlet in the Sutton Lake Recreation Area, an administrative unit of the Siuslaw National Forest. Most (more than 90 percent) of the shoreline of the lake is privately owned and there are numerous houses, the largest concentration being on the east side of the northeast basin.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">The water quality in Sutton Lake is typical of coastal lakes, i.e., low in mineral concentrations and slightly influenced by sea spray. Both basins develop thermal stratification in the summer; oxygen is typically depleted in the hypolimnion from June to September. Water transparency is above average for coastal lakes, but has declined in recent years. The Secchi-disk range in this survey, 1982, ranged from 5.6 to 9.2 feet (1.7 to 2.8 meters); but Kruse (1962) reported a range from 9 to 11.8 feet (2.7 to 3.6 meters). Bryant et al (1979), stated that this lake has become more productive in recent years, when compared to data from a 1973 study (Larson 1973). Total phosphorus, chlorophyl, and nitrogen are more concentrated than in many other coastal lakes, thus making it eutrophic. This may perhaps be due to nutrient contributions from Mercer Creek.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Net phytoplankton samples were collected from both basins on 6/4/79 and showed the following:</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.2em;""><span style=""white-space: pre;"">	</span>Southwest Basin: &nbsp; <em>Dictyosphaerium pulchellum, Staurastrum pinque, <span style=""white-space: pre;"">	</span>Ankistrodesmus falcatus, Fragilaria crotonensis, Volvox spermatopshaera, <span style=""white-space: pre;"">	</span>Sphaerocystis schroeteri,</em> and <em>Dinobyron sertularia</em>.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.2em;""><span style=""white-space: pre;"">	</span>Northeast Basin: <em>Staurastrum paradoxum, Fragilaria crotonensis, Melosira <span style=""white-space: pre;"">	</span>granulate, Tabellaria fenestrata, Asterionella formosa</em>, and <em>Synedra <span style=""white-space: pre;"">	</span>radians</em>.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Nannoplankton samples collected during the 1981/82 survey showed a spring bloom of <em>Asterionella formosa</em>, lower densities in the summer, and an increase in the fall. It is interesting to note the presence of <em>Dinobryon sertularia</em> which is often associated with oligotrophic lakes, but as shown here it may also be common in lakes of higher trophic states.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Since both basins drop off steeply around their perimeter, shoal areas are minimal and macrophyte problems are less severe than in many other coastal lakes. However, macrophytes are abundant in some of the littoral zone (especially <em>Potamogeton, Nuphar</em>, and <em>Lemna</em>) and appear to have increased in the last two decades. Kruse (1962) reported in 1960 that there were several small beds of water milfoil along the shore andbeds of water lilies and water shield. The 1982 survey showed more extensive macrophyte beds around most of the shoreline. The channel between the two basins is weed-choked, but passable for small motor boats. This channel may be receptive to one or more macrophyte control techniques, such as installation of macrophyte screens or applications of herbicides. In summary, Sutton Lake is by all indications eutrophic.</p>

"Lost Lake (225)","225","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;This is one of 14 Lost Lakes in Oregon and, to many residents, the best known because of its location adjacent to the heavily travelled Santiam Pass Highway, Oregon Highway 20. The lake lies within the Willamette National Forest just outside the Mt. Jefferson Wilderness. Lost Lake was probably formed about 3000 years ago at about the same time as Clear Lake, Linton Lake and others in this region of the Central Oregon Cascades. Lava flowing from the Sand Mountain Line of small volcanoes blocked a river channel to create a small basin of interior drainage which now holds the Lost Lake basin. Several small surface streams feed into the lake intermittently, but there is no visible outlet. Water leaves by seepage into the porous lava and by evapotranspiration. The water level fluctuates seasonally and is quite low in summer, dramatically so in drier years. Water-loving willows crowd the marshy shallows of the lake, particularly along the southeast shore. The bottom material is mostly mud mixed with cinders.</p>
<p>Lost Lake is stocked with eastern brook trout and rainbows and also has some native fish. Angling is permitted only until September 1 in order to protect fish that are forced to cluster as the water level drops in summer. There is usually a solid ice cover in early spring and ice-fishing is popular. No motorboats are allowed on the water. A Forest Service campground is located on the west shore adjacent to the highway.</p>
<p>Lost Lake is classified as mesotrophic, in contrast to the large number of oligotrophic lakes in the High Cascades. The concentrations of major ions, alkalinity, conductivity and pH are somewhat above average for Cascade Lakes. Algae populations are sparse and chlorophyl concentrations low, even though the phosphorus is somewhat above average for lakes of the region. The water is sufficiently transparent that the bottom is visible everywhere. This combination of characteristics indicates mesotrophy, but close to oligotrophy.</p>

"Spring Lake","266","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Spring Lake is a large, but extremely shallow water body lying at the east edge of the Klamath Hills. It is a natural sump in an area of interior drainage and as such is managed by the Bureau of Reclamation as a storage pool, a component of the Klamath Basin Project. The Klamath Project derives its water supply from the Klamath River and from the closed basins of this part of Oregon and adjacent California; it allows irrigation of farmland in both states. The Project also provides flood control, recreation, and fish and wildlife benefits. Spring Lake is a small, but important, component of this Project as irrigation water is routed into and out of it via a network of canals.</p>
<p>The Klamath Hills arise immediately to the south and west of the lake to a height of over 1000 feet above the surrounding landscape. These hills are grazed by cattle and are, in part, managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Otherwise the topography in the Spring Lake Valley is relatively flat and most of the land supports irrigated agriculture.</p>
<p>Typical of lakes in interior drainage basins, Spring Lake contains relatively salty water. The concentrations of sodium and sulfate are particularly high, and the conductivity is among the highest measured anywhere in Oregon lakes. The concentration of phosphorus is extremely high. The lake develops dense mats of blue green algae which cover much of the water surface. Water transparency is very limited as a consequence of the algal growth. Because of the very shallow depth and the generous supply of phosphorus, this lake is extremely productive, and is classified as hypereutrophic.</p>

"Floras Lake","198","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Floras Lake, a medium-sized lake on the southern Oregon coast, is an embayment which has been cut off from the ocean by low migrating sand dunes. It exhibits a dendritic, or branching, shape typical of many of the coastal lakes formed in this manner. Still active, these sand dunes are steadily encroaching on the west shore of the lake. Surface inflow is derived from four unnamed tributaries and the outflow is into Floras Creek, also called New River, which enters the ocean through a breach in the sand dunes farther north. The water level in the lake is reported to vary as much as five or six feet annually, an unusually large fluctuation in a natural lake of this type. To the east and south of the lake is a timbered plateau, land which is primarily in private ownership; to the north lies a marshy floodplain. On the east shore is the site of Pacific City, an enthusiastic but ill-fated attempt to establish a Curry County seaport early in this century. The shoreline is now occupied by several summer homes and permanent residences. Only about one mile of the shoreline is in public ownership, this being along the west side in undeveloped Floras Lake State Park. The name Floras is presumably derived from one Fred Flora, an early day settler and miner in the region.</p>
<p>Floras Lake is popular with sport fishermen and summer recreationists and is important for salmon and steelhead runs to the upper tributaries. The lake contains several species of fish; both rainbow and cutthroat trout are stocked and there has been some effort to develop a black bass fishery. A paved public boat ramp is at the north end on Floras Lake Road. There is also a private resort at the northeast end of the lake.</p>
<p>In spite of its proximity to the ocean, the concentrations of sodium and chloride in Floras Lake are slightly below average for coastal lakes. Concentrations of other major ions and the alkalinity are also low, especially in winter and spring. One-third of the lake is shallower than 10 feet and about half is shallower than 15 feet. As a result there are extensive beds of submerged and emergent macrophytes along most of the littoral areas. There is also a noticeable decrease in the amount of shoreline vegetation around the periphery of the lake between the high and low water marks. Floras Lake is usually well mixed, explained by its exposure to the strong and persistent winds of the Cape Blanco region. However, weak thermal stratification has been observed, accompanied by a slight amount of oxygen depletion in the central basin.</p>
<p>The slight oxygen depletion and average values of transparency, chlorophyl and phosphorus concentrations indicate that Floras Lake is mesotrophic. Turbidity is frequently high due to heavy wind mixing and the presence of planktonic algae, although the sample collected on 8/3/82 had a low algal density. The ratio of drainage area to lake surface area and volume is above average for Oregon coastal lakes; thus the flushing rate is greater than average and reduces the likelihood of eutrophication.</p>

"Linton Lake","220","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Linton Lake is a small, deep natural lake lying just inside the Three Sisters Wilderness area on the west slope of the Cascade Mountains. It was created about 3000 years ago when lava, issuing from Collier and Four-in-One Craters to the east, flowed down the canyon of the White Branch River. As the lava solidified it dammed the tributaries, Linton Creek and Obsidian Creek, impounding their flow. The resulting lake occupies the upper end of a canyon, which was quite likely formed by the headward erosion of the two creeks. On three sides the lake basin has very steep slopes and the lake is quite deep, over 90 feet along the southern edge. In contrast, along the west shore there is an extensive shoal area bordering the fresh-looking lava dam. There is no visible surface outflow from Linton Lake; seepage through the lava dam accounts for discharge and there is considerable seasonal fluctuation in water level. Inflowing Linton Creek provides a dramatic auditory and visual display as it tumbles down the steep ridge from the meadows above.</p>
<p>The pristine character and easy accessibility of Linton Lake have made it a popular destination for day-hikers during the short summer season. However, because of the steep forested shoreline, camping opportunities at the lake are very limited. It is reportedly the only High Cascade lake with a native population of brown trout; rainbow trout are stocked regularly by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.</p>
<p>The water in the lake has very low concentrations of major ions and the alkalinity is low. Chlorophyl concentration and water transparency (Secchi disk depth = 45.3 feet; 13.8 meters) indicate that the lake is distinctly oligotrophic. It should be noted that the phosphorus concentration observed on 7/22/82 is quite high, but is not inconsistent with that of other lakes located in volcanic terrain.</p>

"Henry Hagg Lake","84","<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Henry Hagg Lake is a large multipurpose reservoir, created in 1974 by the Bureau of Reclamation with the construction of an earthfill dam on Scoggins Creek in western Washington County. The reservoir was named in honor of Henry Hagg, a prominent Oregon dairyman and Washington County official who died in 1971. Scoggins Dam and Henry Hagg Lake form the primary component of the Bureau of Reclamation's Tualatin Project, which also includes the Patton Valley Pumping Plant, the spring Hill Pumping Plant, 20 booster pumping plants, and 86 miles of piped lateral distribution system. </p>
<p>To early settlers in the Tualatin Valley, the site of the modern project was known as ""Twality Plains."" It was one of the earliest farming settlements in Oregon. Agriculture developed quickly because there were numerous open areas that permitted cultivation without the expense and labor of clearing timber stands, and also because of the fertile soils in the Tualatin Valley. As the population increased, timbered tracts were cleared and more land came under cultivation. Hay, grain, and livestock production were the basis for the early agricultural economy and are still important in the economy of the area. From a small start, irrigation increased substantially and it soon became apparent that storage of water would be needed. Also, flood and drainage problems had been a source of concern since early settlement. Studies by the Bureau of Reclamation and Corps of Engineers made it clear that irrigation and flood control were not the only water resource needs in the area. There was a greater need for municipal and industrial water than originally anticipated. Construction of the long considered project was finally authorized in 1966. Construction of facilities began in 1972 and they were completed in 1978. Scoggins Dam, a 151-foot high earthfill structure was completed in 1974 and the reservoir filled in 1975. Total capacity of Henry Hagg Lake at full pool is 59,910 acre-feet, according to Bureau of Reclamation data. </p>
<p>Benefits from the project have been several. Agricultural land has been more productive by providing a dependable water supply through the growing season, especially during the late summer period. The top 20,300 acre-feet of reservoir space is used for flood control, sufficient to completely regulate a flood the size which occurs about once in 50 years at the damsite. Another 14,000 acre-feet of water are used for supplemental municipal and industrial purposes for four communities. In addition, 16,900 acre-feet of water are made available to improve the water quality of the Tualatin River by scheduled releases of water in the summer when natural flows are low. </p>
<p>Henry Hagg Lake has also become a very important recreational resource for people in the northern Willamette Valley. Boat launching and mooring facilities have been constructed and there are large day-use areas provided with picnic tables, shelters, and water and sanitary facilities. Water-skiing is a popular activity at the lake; but the south end of the lake has a 10 mph speed limit for the benefit of sailors, swimmers, and other users. The lake is stocked annually with rainbow trout and has rapidly become one of the state's more popular fishing lakes. A fish trap was built below Scoggins Dam to collect, for hatchery use, the anadromous fish blocked by the dam. Several dead trees were left in the reservoir to attract osprey, and portions of the reservoir area are managed to provide winter range for elk and black-tailed deer. </p>
<p>The drainage basin contributing to Henry Hagg Lake is a 37.5 square mile area in the foothills of the Coast Range. Saddle Mountain, 3535 feet above sea level, is the highest point in the drainage basin, indeed the highest point in the northern Oregon Coast Range. Geologically the area is underlain by a mixture of sandstone and older volcanic rocks that typify the foothills of the Coast Range. Thick soils of weathered clay and silt overlie the bedrock. A second-growth Douglas fir forest covers most of the drainage basin, with some open grassland used for grazing; there are also some small farms. Land ownership in the basin is, in part, private and, in part, federal (administered by the Bureau of Land Management). The shoreline of the reservoir was originally owned by the federal government (Bureau of Reclamation), although ownership has reverted to Washington County. </p>
<p>At full pool Henry Hagg Lake covers 1153 acres; it has a maximum depth of 110 feet, an average depth of 51 feet, and the water level fluctuates about 22 feet annually. It has, in general, maintained good water quality since filling in 1975. However, some problems have developed in recent years. Because of its recent origin, the banks of the reservoir are not yet stabilized and erosion and slumping produce local turbidity, particularly when waves are generated on the water surface by wind or motorboats. A pronounced thermal stratification develops in the lake in summer, with a sharp thermocline at about 30 feet (10 meters) depth. There is some tendency for oxygen depletion in the deeper water, below 30 feet. In recent years, unwanted rough fish species in the lake have increased in numbers, and they compete with trout for food and space. Plans have been made by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife to chemically poison the lake to eliminate the unwanted species; however, this effort has been postponed until 1984 because of funding cuts. </p>
<p>Concentrations of major ions in the lake are comparable to those in other Willamette Valley reservoirs which are influenced by turbidity, such as Fern Ridge Lake and Hills Creek Lake, and somewhat higher than in most other lakes and reservoirs. At times there are large flocks of ducks and other water birds on the lake and around the shoreline. The phytoplankton occurring in the summer (McHugh, personal communication) are predominantly mesotrophic to eutrophic diatoms (<em>Asterionella formosa</em>, <em>Synedra ulna</em>), with occasional blue-green algal blooms occurring at a few localities in the reservoir. Blooms of Volvox globator (a green alga) have also been observed and may be common to new reservoirs as it has also been observed in newly created Lost Creek Lake near Medford. Concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyl, the water transparency, and the partial depletion of dissolved oxygen in the hypolimnion all indicate the lake is highly mesotrophic. It is one of the more productive lakes in the Willamette Valley. It is common for new impoundments to be more eutrophic in the first few years after flooding while the easily available nutrients in vegetation and in the upper soil layers are entering the lake. The lake may shift to a lower trophic state as it stabilizes with time.</p>","17090010004615","","142403732","01158095","Henry Hagg Lake","6"

"Lower Erma Bell Lake","228","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Lower Erma Bell Lake lies in the forested plateau area encompassed by the Waldo Lake Recreation Area, a management unit of the Willamette National Forest. The string of Lower, Middle and Upper Erma Bell Lakes is a back-country destination visited frequently throughout the summer. The name Erma Bell is in honor of a National Forest Service employee who died in an automobile accident in 1918. This volcanic terrain north of Waldo Lake has been modified by glacial action which has left numerous pockets in the surface, many of them occupied by small lakes such as the Erma Bells. The glacially carved valley in which the lakes sit is occupied by the Middle Fork of the Willamette River. Lower Erma Bell is a rock-rimmed, circular lake surrounded by a thick forest of Douglas fir and western hemlock. Middle Erma Bell Lake, located just 200 yards to the south, provides a noticeable primary inflow as water tumbles down the 100 foot difference in elevation between the two lakes. The lakes are stocked annually with rainbow trout and also support a population of native trout.</p>
<p>The data presented in this report pertain only to Lower Erma Bell Lake. It is quite deep for a lake this small. The bottom slopes down steeply, providing only a minimal amount of shallow water and very little growth of macrophytes. Concentrations of dissolved ions are low, yet somewhat higher than in other nearby lakes, for example, Mink Lake and Waldo Lake. Nutrients are low and the development of plankton is therefore sparse, although algal blooms have been reported in both Lower and Middle Erma Bell. Water transparency is excellent and the pH of the water is slightly acid, both characteristics of dilute, unproductive waters. There is some oxygen depletion in the stratified hypolimnion; however, by all other measures Lower Erma Bell Lake is distinctly oligotrophic.</p>

"Lake Oswego","110","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Lake Oswego, located in the heart of the city of the same name, is a well-known but difficult-to-see lake in the Portland metropolitan area. The entire shoreline is private land and rimmed with residential neighborhoods, and the lake is visible only in glimpses from the roads surrounding it. The lakebed is owned and maintained by the Lake Oswego Shorefront Committee, a corporation whose members have lake frontage or access rights to the water and recreational facilities through property agreements. Even with this restricted access, Lake Oswego receives very heavy recreational use. According to Frenkel (1975), it is the seventh busiest body of water in Oregon, and perhaps the busiest for use by water-skiers.</p>
<p>Lake Oswego has an interesting geologic history. It occupies a former channel of the Tualatin River, carved in Columbia River basalt. Downcutting and excavation eventually captured the main channel of the Tualatin River, leaving the old Lake Oswego route abandoned. About 13,000 years ago flood waters from glacial Lake Missoula raced down the Columbia River, backed up the Willamette River, and poured through the Lake Oswego gap, deeply scouring and enlarging the channel.</p>
<p>The cultural history of the lake is equally as interesting. It was called Waluga (""Wild Swan"") by the Indians, while early settlers gave it the less appealing name of Sucker Lake. Discovery of iron ore beds brought the first iron furnace west of the Rockies, built just below the lake in 1805 at the point where Oswego Creek pours into the Willamette River. Although the area did not live up to initial predictions that it would become the ""Pittsburgh of the West"", numerous summer cottages and then permanent homes were built on attractive lake front property. In 1913 the name of the lake was changed to Lake Oswego for the community that had grown up on its shores, in turn named for pioneer Walter Durham's hometown of Oswego, New York. Early in the century a canal connected with the Tualatin River and a small dam on the outlet increased the water level of the lake by several feet. The purpose of the canal was to provide a commercial route for flat-bottomed wheat freighters and rafts of logs. Through neglect, the canal filled with grass and willows, impeding its use. In 1939 a project to clear and widen the canal begun, but work was interrupted by World War II; it was completed in 1948. In February, 1941, the Oregon Iron and Steel Corporation gave the lake bed to the Lake Oswego Shorefront Committee, but has retained control of the dam and power plant. Once a year the lake is lowered about six feet for a three week period so that owners may repair their seawalls and docks.</p>
<p>The water quality in Lake Oswego is poor and by all indications it is a hypereutrophic lake. When sampled on 9/21/82, the hypolimnion was anoxic (oxygen-depleted) below 22 feet (7 meters), the transparency was low (Secchi disk depth = 4.6 feet; 1.4 meters), and the concentrations of total phosphorus and phytoplankton were very high, as were nitrogen values. Conductivity, major ion concentrations, and pH were also quite high (although calcium was relatively low). These are all characteristics of a hypereutrophic lake. Nutrient sources into the water include the Tualatin River (the major inflow), activities by homeowners (lawn fertilizers, insect sprays, etc.), non-point sources from within the extensively developed drainage basin, and from waterfowl on the lake. Also, the anoxic sediments probably release phosphorus.</p>
<p>Macrophytes are not a problem. In fact, very few macrophytes can be found in the littoral areas of the lake, probably a result of the annual lake draw-down. Phytoplankton blooms are common, and the City of Lake Oswego treats these blooms with copper sulfate as they start to develop. However, several residents and lake users have indicated that these algal blooms are not bothersome. The phytoplankton density observed on 9/21/82 (3696 algae per ml.) was among the highest from any Oregon lake. More unusual, however, is the species composition of the phytoplankton. With the exception of Rhodomonas minuta which is widespread, the dominant algae were not found in any other lake sampled in this state-wide inventory, even at low densities. It may be that the annual additions of copper have a significant effect upon the phytoplankton species, with only copper tolerant species able to survive.</p>
<p>There is very little existing biological and chemical data on Lake Oswego, partially because it is a private lake without public access. Future studies on Lake Oswego could be mutually beneficial for the scientific community as well as for city residents. The present management of the lake includes two treatments that would be of interest to limnologists: lake draw-down, and copper additions to the water. Monitoring lake conditions before, during, and after these treatments could provide insight into basic limnological interactions under actual field conditions, while the generated data would also benefit the City of Lake Oswego by providing information that may reduce the cost, or increase the efficiency, of present management practices.</p>

"Eckman Lake","190","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Eckman Lake, lying in the lower end of Eckman Slough, is a water impoundment now separated from the Alsea River estuary by the causeway of Oregon Highway 34. The name Eckman is from a Scandinavian settler who lived nearby many years ago. Surface inflow to the lake is from the upstream portions of the slough and through a marshy area on the west side of the lake. Outflow is through a culvert on the northwest end into the Alsea River. The drainage basin is, for the most part, in private ownership with a few blocks of timberland in the upper reaches managed by the Siuslaw National Forest. It is a region of fairly gentle relief which lies on a marine terrace covered by relict, stabilized sand dunes. The shoreline is also in private ownership, except for W. B. Nelson State Park, and consists of a mixture of homes, forested land and marshes. The shoreline is zoned for single-family residential use on the east and west and for rural residential use on the south. One of the major private landowners is the Port of Alsea, and the reservoir itself is zoned as a marine waterway: However, management is primarily the responsibility of the Oregon State Highway Department and the Department of Fish and Wildlife.</p>
<p>Except at the north end, Eckman Lake is very shallow and submerged macrophytes have developed throughout. Bottom material is mostly silt. Major ion chemistry is unusual -- the concentrations of sodium and chloride and the conductivity are the highest of any of the coastal lakes in this survey, suggesting that sea water may leak into the lake from the Alsea River estuary during high tides. The lake sometimes becomes nearly anoxic (oxygen depleted) below the six-foot depth and pH is sometimes quite high. By all indications Eckman Lake should be classified as eutrophic. Local citizens have reported in past years that tailings from upstream quarry operations drain into the lake; however, this has not been verified. Eckman Lake is a highly valuable local recreation facility with swimming, boating and fishing. It contains cutthroat and rainbow trout and, on occasion, coho salmon. The Department of Fish and Wildlife has attempted to establish a warm water fishery, stocking juvenile largemouth bass and adult black crappie.</p>

"Lake Owyhee","112","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Lake Owyhee is the largest reservoir in Oregon. It covers an area of 13,900 acres and winds its way along 52 miles of the spectacular Owyhee River canyon in the southeast corner of the state. Owyhee Dam is a 417-foot high concrete arch structure, constructed from 1928 to 1932 by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. Owyhee Dam and Lake Owyhee are the core of the Owyhee Project, which furnishes irrigation water for 105,249 acres of land lying along the west side of the Snake River in eastern Oregon and southwestern Idaho. The project consolidated several ditch companies and irrigation districts that formerly obtained water from the Owyhee River, Succor Creek, and the Snake River. Approximately 72 percent of the project's acreage is in Oregon and 28 percent in Idaho. The project also includes 172 miles of canals, 543 miles of laterals, 9 pumping plants, and 227 miles of drains. Water is released from the lake through a 3.5-mile tunnel to Tunnel Canyon where it is run into North and South Canals. The North Canal distributes water to the Mitchell Butte and Dead Ox Flat Divisions near the towns of Nyssa and Ontario. The South Canal distributes water south to the Succor Creek Division near Homedale, Idaho. Originally, the irrigation works were designed to supply water to the entire project by gravity from Lake Owyhee. Because of the irregular flow of the Owyhee River, water users found it advisable to store a two-year supply. This storage is made possible by utilizing water pumped from the Snake River to irrigate 35,000 acres of lower lying land.</p>
<p>The ""Owyhee Country"" had been visited by scouts, traders, and trappers in the early part of the nineteenth century, and the name ""Owyhee"" is derived from the old way of spelling ""Hawaii"". A number of natives from the Hawaiian Islands were brought to the Pacific Northwest to work as laborers for the Hudson's Bay Company and the Northwest Company. They were also used as boatmen to transport fur traders into the Snake River country. Peter Skene Ogden was the first to make note of this fact in the report on his second Snake River expedition in 1826. He noted that two islanders had been killed near the river in 1819 by Snake Indians, and the river was named for these Hawaiians. The river drains a large area in Oregon and western Idaho, and there are several other geographic features bearing the name, derived from the name of the river.</p>
<p>The drainage basin of the river is generally coincident with the physiographic province called the Owyhee Uplands. It is a semiarid region characterized by a moderately to highly dissected upland surface with few perennial streams. The Owyhee River rises in Nevada and also flows through Idaho and Oregon to its junction with the Snake River near Nyssa. Several tributaries join it along its course, although only three (the Little Owyhee River, Jordan Creek, and Rattlesnake Creek) are perennial. The drainage pattern is well developed and there is little interior drainage in the region. Elevations range from over 6000 feet above sea level in the Mahogany Mountains to 2670 at the lake surface. Most of the precipitation occurs during the winter and at higher elevations. On an average annual basis, low precipitation produces relatively low runoff although large variations can be expected on both an annual and seasonal basis. Natural flows, except for those resulting in snowmelt in the spring, are usually quite low. Average discharge of the Owyhee River above the reservoir is 670,000 acre-feet per year, with nearly 70 percent of this coming in March, April, and May.</p>
<p>Lake Owyhee has about 150 miles of shoreline twisting through a canyon of rugged and spectacular beauty. Although the area is remote and the lake has only two points of access, it has developed an excellent warm-water fishery and experiences heavy recreational use. It has become noted for its largemouth bass and crappie angling. Some rainbow trout are also taken. The lake also provides excellent waterfowl hunting, and the surrounding hills and canyons offer many opportunities for the pursuit of upland gamebirds. There is also extensive use for pleasure boating and water-skiing. An excellent state park was established in 1958 adjacent to the lower end of the lake. It includes picnic grounds, a campground, and boat launching ramps. The upper end of the lake also marks the terminus of whitewater raft trips down a spectacular stretch of the Owyhee River.</p>
<p>The major influence on water quality in this reservoir is from the inflowing Owyhee River. The drainage basin has a surface water runoff problem, which results in very high phosphorus and major ion concentrations in the reservoir. Although on 9/7/82 total phosphorus concentration of 0.045 mg/l was measured, a more extensive survey performed by EPA (1978) reported most values near 0.100 mg/l. Conductivity was 160 umhos/cm on 9/7/82 reflecting high concentrations of major ions. According to McHugh (1972) there is no evidence of enrichment from human sources. Reservoirs located in arid or semiarid areas with unleached soils are usually well-provided with essential nutrients, so that productivity is high. Nutrients are obtained from the bottom mud and from inflowing streams.</p>
<p>The phytoplankton density is fairly high, but not as high as would be predicted from the phosphorus concentration. The phytoplankton are probably light limited to some extent as a result of the suspended sediment in the water, which is also derived from the inlet. Water transparency is low 5.9 feet (1.8 meters), and is influenced by the suspended sediment. On 9/7/82, a light bloom of <em>Aphanizomenon flos-aquae</em> was evident in the reservoir, but was not detected in the sample collected near the dam. However, on downwind shores the <em>Aphanizomenon </em>density was quite high, and piles of the blue-green alga were found along the shoreline. This alga is a problem in several embayments where the winds frequently concentrate it.</p>
<p>The reservoir stratifies in summer at about 36 feet (11 meters) deep. The surface water warms appreciably, and the entire epilimnion (surface to 30 feet; 10 meters) was warmer than 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius) on 9/7/82. The hypolimnion experiences partial dissolved oxygen depletion, but there are no records of the hypolimnion becoming totally anoxic. Due to a rocky bottom, steeply sloping littoral zones, and a limited water transparency, there are only occasional macrophytes. All indicators of trophic state place Owyhee Reservoir in the eutrophic category.</p>

"Pamelia Lake","249","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Pamelia Lake is one of the most popular wilderness lakes in Oregon due to the combination of easy access and a spectacular setting. The two-mile trail from the end of Pamelia Creek Road is gentle and provides continual views of the lively stream. The lake itself lies at the foot of Mt. Jefferson, Oregon's second highest mountain. Glacial activity carved the valley, leaving the classic U-shape so evident in the accompanying photo. Subsequent to the withdrawal of glaciers a landslide blocked Hunts Creek, impounding its waters to form Pamelia Lake. Hunts Creek originates about one and one-half miles up valley in Hunts Cove, a beautiful glacial cirque which holds two small lakes, Hunts Lake and Hanks Lake. Several other small, unnamed streams enter the lake from all sides. Pamelia Creek, the outflow, is a tributary of the North Santiam River, joining it about six miles downstream from the lake. Seasonal fluctuation in water level is extreme, apparently due to loss of water through a lava fault; during the dry year of 1976-77 the lake was reduced to a few acres in extent. Spring and summer snowmelt runoff restores the water level. The small, steep drainage basin for Pamelia Lake is covered with a dense coniferous forest, except in several areas recently disturbed by rockslides. The lake is named for Pamelia Ann Berry, a cook with John Minto's 1879 road building party who ""always exhibited unfailing cheerfulness.""</p>
<p>The Pamelia Lake area has received heavy use for many years and camping has had a definite impact on the shoreline environment. The lake is open year-round to anglers and ice-fishing is permitted for those willing to hike in over the snow. Natural reproduction of cutthroat trout is so rapid that the fish do not get very large because of competition for food. To help reduce the overpopulation, a special bag limit of 30 fish per day and 60 in possession is allowed, with no minimum size limit. Brook trout also are found in the lake.</p>
<p>Pamelia Lake is oblong in shape, defined by the contours of the glacial valley, and it contains a considerable number of floating logs which drift about with changes in the wind. Water in the lake is generally low in chemical constituents, and the alkalinity and conductivity are low, although slightly higher than in many other Cascade Mountain lakes. Total phosphorus is higher than might be expected for a wilderness lake and indicates a mesotrophic state. The source of this excess phosphorus may be from marshy areas upstream or from springs located along the eastern shoreline. Another likely source is the considerable amount of human activity along the shoreline in summer. Phytoplankton species (<em>Asterionella</em>, <em>Synedra</em>, <em>Nitzschia</em>, <em>Melosira</em>, <em>Tabellaria</em>, and some <em>Anabaena</em>) also indicate mesotrophic conditions, although the densities of these algae are low.</p>

"John C Boyle Reservoir","214","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;John C. Boyle Reservoir is a large hydro-electric project which was built in the late 1950s by Pacific Power and Light Company. Known originally as Big Bend Reservoir, for a large meander in the Klamath River, it has since been renamed in honor of the chief engineer of construction. Most of the water resource development in the Klamath Basin has been for irrigation and there is a large network of dams, reservoirs, and delivery systems for this purpose. In contrast, John C. Boyle Dam and Reservoir and the Link River Dam at the head of the Klamath River were constructed primarily for power production.</p>
<p>The John C. Boyle powerplant, located five miles downstream from the dam, has an 85,000 kilowatt capacity. Streamflow through the reservoir is regulated primarily by outflow from Upper Klamath Lake and there are diversions upstream for irrigation. Large diurnal fluctuations in water level are caused by operation of the powerplant upstream at Link River Dam and downstream at the John C. Boyle powerplant.</p>
<p>The shape of the reservoir is elongate, with a narrow southern end which reaches depths greater than 40 feet behind the dam, and a much wider northern end with depths of 10 feet or less. The reservoir receives the discharge from Klamath Lake and therefore shares many of the same chemical and biological characteristics. There is also a considerable contribution from groundwater which dilutes the Klamath River water. This seepage averages 10 to 25 percent of the flow on an annual basis, but can contribute as much as 25 to 50 percent during the summer low flow period. The concentrations of major ions and conductivity are very high. The concentration of phosphorus and chlorophyll are also very high, and indicate highly eutrophic conditions (nearly hypereutrophic). Water transparency is very limited and is a further indication of eutrophic conditions. The short retention time noted here is probably not representative of circulation throughout all segments of the reservoir, as indicated by the extensive growth of rooted macrophytes in the shallow areas.</p>

"Cold Springs Reservoir","172","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Cold Springs Reservoir is a large irrigation impoundment near Hermiston, located in the Cold Springs National Wildlife Refuge. Established in 1909, the Refuge with its tree-lined reservoir lies in sharp contrast with its desert surroundings. It is an important wintering and nesting area for more than a dozen species of migratory waterfowl. The Refuge encompasses 3,117 acres and is cooperatively managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Hermiston Irrigation District. The reservoir was formed by construction of a dam across Cold Springs Wash in 1908 by the Bureau of Reclamation, although it did not fill until 1911. At full pool the reservoir covers over 1500 acres and has a capacity of about 50,000 acre-feet. The flow of Cold Springs Wash is insufficient to fill the reservoir, and the major supply is spring runoff from the Umatilla River delivered by the Umatilla Project feed canal. Waters from the reservoir serve the irrigation needs of the local area, and as withdrawals are made through the summer, water levels drop rapidly. By late August, an average of 200 acres of water remain at minimum pool. The lake bed exposed during the drawdown produces an abundance of vegetation which is utilized by a variety of wildlife.</p>
<p>Recreational activities in the area include hunting, birdwatching, and fishing. The reservoir was treated in 1967 to eliminate rough fish, at the same time that the Umatilla River was treated. It has since been stocked with largemouth bass, bluegill, and crappie. Crappie fishing in the spring is particularly good. Brown bullheads have also flourished. Boats can be used, but no motors are allowed, and launching is difficult because of the fluctuating water levels and exposed mudflats. There is no overnight camping near the reservoir.</p>
<p>The basin shape is characteristic of reservoirs constructed in areas of relatively shallow relief. The maximum depth just behind the dam is 71 feet, and average depth is 32 feet. There are two large shallow arms, Despair Gulch arm to the southeast and Cold Springs Canyon arm to the northeast. Hypereutrophic Cold Springs Reservoir is easily one of the most eutrophic bodies of water in the state, and a number of forces act in concert to keep it eutrophic. The major ion concentrations, alkalinity, and conductivity are all above average, even for reservoirs in eastern Oregon. The local climate is dry and there is not a great deal of runoff to dilute weathering products from the drainage basin. The concentration of phosphorus is very high, and more than enough to provoke algal blooms. Some of the phosphorus no doubt accompanies the major ions derived from the drainage basin. In addition, there is extensive agriculture around the reservoir and very large populations of overwintering waterfowl, both of which contribute additional phosphorus. The reservoir is too shallow to stratify, thus keeping nutrients continuously in circulation. As a consequence, there are frequent dense blooms of phytoplankton, giving rise to very high concentrations of chlorophyl and very restricted water transparency. In summary, because of the shallow mean depth and the generous supply of nutrients Cold Springs Reservoir is unavoidably hypereutrophic.</p>

"Lost River Pool","226","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Lost River Reservoir is an impoundment on the Lost River which serves as a vital component of the Bureau of Reclamation's Klamath Project. The Project is an interstate agreement which provides for the beneficial use of water resources in the Klamath Basin. The annual yield of Lost River is used as the principal source of water for irrigation of more than 200,000 acres of land both in Oregon and California. The river originates with the outflow of Clear Lake Reservoir in Modoc County, California, and discharges ultimately into Tule Lake, California. It thus constitutes a naturally closed basin. Historically, Tule Lake was a large natural sump, which would rise during periods of high runoff and slowly recede during summer and fall due to evaporation. One of the first facilities built in the Klamath Project was the Lost River Diversion Dam and a canal connecting the Lost and Klamath Rivers. Since completion in 1912, this facility has provided for the diversion of Lost River flood flows into the Klamath River and allowed reclamation of the bed of Tule Lake.</p>
<p>Lost River is a shallow, sluggish stream which enters Oregon through the Langell Valley. During its course through Langell Valley, the river disappears for several miles; hence its name. Miller Creek is the largest tributary, entering from the east after regulation in Gerber Reservoir. Near the town of Bonanza the river turns to the west. In this area several large springs contribute to the flow. After flowing through Olene Gap, the water is controlled by the Lost River Diversion Dam. Below the dam, the river is essentially a canal during the irrigation season. The contributing drainage basin includes a large amount of irrigated land which significantly depletes the natural flow. That portion of the basin not in irrigated land is mostly rangeland and there are some forested areas at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Lost River Reservoir is one of the saltier lakes in Oregon, although it is not considered a sump, or an evaporation basin, because of irrigation withdrawals. However, because of the extensive evaporation in the basin, the concentrations of ions are rather high, and conductivity is well above average for eastern Oregon reservoirs. Both alkalinity and pH are also rather high. The concentration of phosphorus in the lake is sufficient to support active growth of algae. Algal blooms appear frequently and the chlorophyl concentrations indicate eutrophic conditions. Water transparency is very limited because of the growth of algae and the presence of inorganic turbidity; there are extensive growths of submerged and emergent macrophytes in the reservoir. The active growth of algae and macrophytes supports a productive food chain, and the reservoir has a popular warm water fishery. By all indications it is classified as eutrophic.</p>

"Crump Lake","180","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Crump Lake is one of several lakes in a 40-mile chain in the Warner Valley of south-central Oregon. The valley is a large fault-block basin, and its floor is virtually a chain of marshes, shallow intermittent lakes, and drained meadows. From south to north, Pelican is the uppermost lake in the chain, followed by Crump and Hart and finishing at Bluejoint Lake. They vary greatly in size; all have been dry or practically dry at times, and the lower ones have been dry for several years, whereas during periods of high water, many of the lakes merge. Total drop in elevation in the lake-bed surface from Crump to Bluejoint Lake is only 13 feet. All these lakes are remnants of a large pluvial lake of about 500 square miles which covered the Warner Valley during the Pleistocene Epoch.</p>
<p>Crump Lake can be considered as transitional between a true closed-basin lake, such as Harney and Summer Lakes, and those that overflow every year. It overflows during many years, discharging into Hart Lake. Input to the lake is via direct precipitation, 10 to 15 inches per year, and runoff from Deep Creek and Twentymile Creek. There is very little contribution from groundwater. Crump Lake is one of the least disturbed of the Warner Valley Lakes, and has been evaluated for potential as a registered natural landmark. The lake and adjoining marshland support a rich spectrum of wildlife. Nesting waterfowl include white pelicans, Canada geese, and several species of ducks. Sandhill cranes and shore birds also inhabit the area. Surrounding vegetation is typical of the Great Basin desert, with sagebrush and juniper. Ownership of land on the valley floor is part state and part private.The valley sides are, for the most part, federal land administered by the Bureau of Land Management.</p>
<p>Like other shallow, alkali lakes in this area, Crump Lake has very high concentrations of phosphorus, major ions, and chlorophyl, and the water transparency is extremely limited by the presence of suspended organic particles. On 7/4/82 a transparency of only 1.3 feet (0.4 meters) was recorded. By all indications the ecological character of the lake is hypereutrophic. However, because Crump Lake does overflow in many years, it has a lower amount of solutes than the truly closed-basin lakes of the area.</p>

"Cooper Creek Reservoir","174","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Cooper Creek Reservoir is a long, narrow impoundment which stores the flow of Cooper Creek, a tributary of Sutherlin Creek. The dam is about eight miles upstream from the North Umpqua River. It was built in the late 1960s by the Soil Conservation Service as a multi-purpose water resource project, with primary uses for both municipal supplies and public recreation. The drainage basin is mostly private forest land; the shoreline is also mostly private land, although public access is available on all sides. Douglas County has some shoreline property and has built two picnic areas and two paved boat ramps. Quite a bit of water skiing is done on the reservoir, an activity that conflicts with fishing, although a five mile per hour speed limit is enforced in the fishing areas. Cooper Creek Reservoir is very popular with local anglers and is a good producer of rainbow trout, largemouth bass and crappies. Crappie angling is especially good in the arms of the lake during spring and early summer.</p>
<p>The reservoir is relatively shallow with a mean depth of 23 feet. It is deepest (70 feet) near the dam at the western end and becomes progressively shallower toward the southeast where Cooper Creek enters. Sodium and chloride concentrations are remarkably high, similar to nearby Plat I reservoir. Conductivity is also well above average for southern Oregon reservoirs and there is some evidence of even greater conductivity in water near the bottom of the reservoir (USGS, 1979). This suggests that the reservoir may be somewhat meromictic, or permanently stratified. During summer, the water is sometimes anoxic (depleted of oxygen) below 40 feet. Rooted macrophytes develop in shallow water areas.</p>

"Obenchain Reservoir","245","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Obenchain Reservoir is a small water impoundment which, in conjunction with several other similar facilities, helps to maintain agricultural production in this semi-arid region of South Central Oregon. The reservoir was constructed in the early 1950s with a 26-foot high, earthfill dam on Fritz Creek. A second dam was necessary to impound a sufficient amount of water in this area of low relief. Inflow to the reservoir is intermittent and the water level fluctuates considerably because of irrigation withdrawals. According to local residents it dries up completely in some years. Although located within the boundaries of the Fremont National Forest, Obenchain Reservoir is on private land and is privately owned and operated. There are no recreational facilities and no boat launching facilities. Nevertheless, there is a well used camp spot at the south end of the lake and local residents frequently fish the lake from the shore and from small boats.</p>
<p>The reservoir is relatively shallow (mean depth = 5 ft), reaching a maximum depth of only 18 feet. The concentrations of ions and the conductivity are about average for eastern Oregon reservoirs and the pH is sometimes well above average (8.5 or more). The concentration of phosphorus is high, but water transparency is better than average (13.0 feet; 4.0 meters). Macrophytes grow over a large portion of the bottom and are responsible for most of the primary production in Obenchain Reservoir; the populations of phytoplankton are not high. An oxygen deficit develops near the bottom at depths greater than 16 feet. Due to this combination of characteristics, particularly the high biological productivity, the reservoir is classified at the higher end of mesotrophy.</p>

"Big Lake","155","<p>
<p>(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). Big Lake is a large mountain lake located just west of the crest of the Cascades and close to the heavily travelled Santiam Pass Highway. It lies below scenic Mt. Washington in a glacially carved valley known as Hidden Valley. This is an area of gentle topography and open meadows, underlain by permeable volcanic bedrock. Although the area receives about 90 inches of annual rainfall, there are no permanent surface streams entering the lake; most of the inflow is subsurface seepage, and there are a few small intermittent streams during the snowmelt season. There is no surface outflow. A dominant feature of the valley is an area of 8000 acres immediately west of the lake which was burned in 1967 by a lightning caused forest fire. However, the landscape appears to be recovering well and striking floral displays help reduce the visual contrast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big Lake is one of the most popular recreation sites in this section of the Cascades. In the summer, visitors come for boating, swimming, and fishing. A 41-unit campground on the western shore has been established by the Willamette National Forest, and a large SeventhDay Adventist youth camp is on the opposite side of the lake. The lake used to be an excellent producer of brook trout, but they now run second to kokanee; cutthroat trout are also present.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The water quality in Big Lake is exceptionally good and it is classified as ultraoligotrophic. Other nearby ultraoligotrophic lakes are Waldo Lake and Mink Lake. All three have conductivity values below 5 umhos/cm, and all lie at high elevations in drainage basins with mostly gentle slopes. Big Lake, however, receives much heavier use than do the others, yet remains very pristine and unproductive. Major ion concentrations, chlorophyll, and phosphorus are all very low, and transparency is very high. The phytoplankton biomass is very low, and the species present (predominantly Chromulina sp. and Oocystic pusilla on 8/29/81) support the ultraoligotrophic classification. Big Lake must be considered as sensitive to future cultural influences on water quality. Periodic monitoring of water quality is advisable so that possible future changes can be detected before serious disruptions occur.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-top: 14px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial;"">(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). Smith and Bybee Lakes are located in the northwest corner of the city of Portland, and sit in the midst of an industrial area near a sewage treatment plant, a sanitary landfill, and fill material from past dredging activities in the Columbia River. Very little recreational use is made of the lakes, in part because access is very difficult. Most of the surrounding land is privately owned. Easiest access is by boat from the Columbia Slough, and small boats can be put into the slough from several rights-of-way off North Portland Road. There is some warm water fishing in Bybee Lake, but to date no attempt has been made to develop a fishery.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""border-style: initial; border-color: initial;"">The lakes are considered to be part of the Columbia Slough hydrologic system. Bybee Lake is connected to the Willamette River via the slough, and a narrow channel connects Smith Lake to Bybee Lake. Water levels in the shallow lakes are controlled by the level of the Columbia River and to a lesser extent (shorter durations in the winter) by the Willamette River. The average tidal-modified river fluctuations in Columbia Slough are estimated to be three feet and a significant amount of tidal flushing occurs in Bybee Lake, but not in Smith Lake. In late summer, Bybee Lake drains almost entirely during low tide and may reach a depth of more than four feet at high tide. In winter the lakes receive water from precipitation and Willamette River floods, although high Columbia River flows occasionally pulse in. These sporadic peak flows may cause the lakes to reflood temporarily. They fill during the May to July freshet on the Columbia River, then slowly drop as tides permit.

The Bybee Lake plug was removed in 1967 and in the next year the Smith Lake plug was relocated about 250 feet farther upstream in North Slough. In 1973 the Smith Lake plug was partially removed and a four-foot wide ditch was excavated to connect a swale near the upper end of North Slough with Bybee Lake when the Columbia River stage is greater than seven feet. On 8/31/82 a potentially significant change was effected on the hydrology of the two lakes. A water control structure was placed on the Columbia Slough near Bybee Lake by the Port of Portland at the request of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. When in operation, tidal flushing of Bybee Lake on a daily basis would be eliminated, and regular annual winter and late spring flooding would be reduced. Water fluctuations in both Smith and Bybee Lakes would be controlled and approximately 1100 acres of year-round lake surface would be formed, to be filled by rain water unless high water tops the banks of North Slough or the plug. A primary purpose of this modification is to avert epidemics of avian botulism, which have occurred in ducks around the lakes.

"Hart Lake","207","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Hart Lake is the largest of the Warner Valley Lakes, a 40-mile chain of a dozen lakes in South-Central Oregon connected by sloughs and bordered by marshes. The Warner Valley is a fault-block basin, and the lakes are the remnants of pluvial Lake Warner, in existence during the Pleistocene Epoch. The eastern margin of the valley is bordered by an impressive escarpment, Hart Mountain, which rises 3000 feet above the valley floor. It is the site of the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge, established in 1936 to preserve habitat for antelope. It is also home to mule deer and bighorn sheep. The numerous Warner Valley Lakes provide habitat for egrets and white pelicans, and serve as nesting grounds for migratory waterfowl.</p>
<p>Hart Lake is the most permanent of the Warner Valley Lakes. Water is supplied by the overflow from Crump Lake and by a number of intermittent streams, primarily Honey Creek. Much of the outflow is used for irrigation, so that the lakes downstream from Hart Lake remain dry or almost dry except during very wet years. In some years, the lake is pumped dry by late summer. Because of large fluctuations in the lake level between wet and dry years, a dike was built about 1950 at the north end to store more water for irrigation. There is some recreational activity at the lake, mainly fishing. It is fished mainly for catfish, which are numerous and of good size. There are also largemouth bass, crappie, and some rainbow and cutthroat trout. The shoreline is in private ownership except where bordered by the refuge. There are no facilities at the lake for overnight camping.</p>
<p>The water quality characteristics of Hart Lake are largely a result of its shallowness. Water transparency is extremely limited by suspended inorganic particles which are stirred from the lake bottom by wave action. The transparency is thus not a reliable indicator of trophic state in this lake. Nutrient concentrations are very high (nitrate 0.17 mg/l and phosphorus 0.351 mg/1), and they tend to indicate a hypereutrophic condition. However, the chlorophyll concentration is typical of mesotrophic lakes; phytoplankton are not nutrient limited, but rather are restricted by available light (and perhaps other factors associated with the abundant suspended solids). Overall, the lake is classified as eutrophic, but is highly eutrophic.</p>

"Loon Lake","224","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Loon Lake sits in beautiful surroundings in the Coast Range east of Reedsport and is a classic example of a landslide lake. Great blocks of sandstone fell from the west wall of the Lake Creek valley to lie as a jumbled mass of blocks that impounded the waters of Lake Creek. Carbon-14 dating of trees drowned at the time of damming indicate that the event occurred about 1460 years ago. Loon Lake was originally much longer, extending several miles upstream. Its size is gradually being reduced as the outlet stream erodes through the natural dam. While the sides and outlet end of the lake are flanked by steep, timber-covered slopes, the inlet end is flat pastureland of lakebed origin that became exposed as erosion reduced the height of the barrier at the outlet. Loon Lake was apparently discovered in 1852 by explorers from Scottsburg and named for the presence of loons nesting on the water.</p>
<p>The drainage basin of Loon Lake is primarily forest land, with a mix of private and Bureau of Land Management lands. The lake is heavily used for public recreation, including fishing, camping, and water skiing. A BLM campground, swimming beach, and boat launch are located near the outlet and a resort and private summer cabins flank the upper portion of the lake.</p>
<p>Loon Lake is relatively deep and develops a sharp thermal stratification during the summer. The depth of the thermocline is rather shallow, indicating less wind-induced mixing than is found in Oregon coastal lakes. The water is noticeably turbid during the winter when heavy rains bring much surface runoff. The turbidity persists in the deeper water during the summer and may contribute to density stratification. Deeper water is sometimes low in dissolved oxygen and somewhat higher in conductivity than surface water. These conditions are a consequence of the density stratification.</p>
<p>The quality of the water in the lake is quite good. Extensive growths of macrophytes develop in shallow water areas. During summer months, the concentrations of chlorophyl and phosphorus are quite low and water transparency is quite high. Based on these characteristics, Loon Lake is classified as oligotrophic. The depletion of oxygen in the deeper water is seemingly inconsistent with the chlorophyl and phosphorus data and as noted, suggests that oxygen depletion may be related to material washed into the lake during the winter from the watershed rather than from the decay of plants growing in the lake itself.</p>

"Round Valley Reservoir","257","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Round Valley Reservoir is an irrigation reservoir in South Central Oregon, a semi-arid region with many water storage facilities for irrigation and stock watering. The largest reservoir in the immediate area is Gerber Reservoir, two miles to the north. Round Valley Reservoir was constructed in the 1950s to expand the irrigated acreage upstream from Gerber Reservoir, and hundreds of acres are productive as a result. The structure of the reservoir is unusual in that the dam, a 19-foot high earthfill dam, is at the northeast corner; yet when the reservoir is full, natural outflow occurs from the northwest corner. Water released from the spillway flows into a canal leading to Wildhorse Creek and thence to Gerber Reservoir. Only intermittent surface streams flow into Round Valley Reservoir and the contributing drainage basin is quite small. The entire area is under the administration of the Bureau of Land Management and is primarily rangeland (juniper) used for grazing. Thus, the reservoir serves also as a source for stock watering. There are no recreation facilities at the reservoir and fishing pressure is light.</p>
<p>When the reservoir is full the surface area exceeds 300 acres, but even then it is an extremely shallow impoundment, with a maximum depth of only 6 feet. The concentrations of ions and the conductivity are about average for eastern Oregon reservoirs, but the pH is above average (8 or greater). Calcium, magnesium and sulfate concentrations are high relative to other ions. Macrophytes grow profusely, the concentration of phosphorus is quite high, and chlorophyl concentration is above average for reservoirs in this environment. A plankton tow taken on 8/10/82 collected a solid bloom of the blue-green alga, <em>Gloeotrichia echinulata</em>. Water transparency is very limited (2.3 feet; 0.7 meters) and the water has a somewhat brownish cast. Primary productivity is high, largely due to the growth of the macrophytes. On all counts Round Valley Reservoir is distinctly eutrophic.</p>

"Doris Lake","188","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Doris Lake is a deep, beautifully blue lake in the Three Sisters area of the Central Oregon Cascades. It is a popular destination for backcountry enthusiasts in search of a pristine wilderness lake only a few miles from the highway. Doris Lake is also a popular stopover for hikers continuing to the Mink Lake Basin. Just south of Elk Lake on the Cascade Lakes Highway, the Six Lakes Trail heads west through a dense forest of lodgepole pine. Blow Lake is two miles from the trailhead; Doris Lake is about three miles in.</p>
<p>The drainage basin is very small and consists of steep, forested slopes on the north side. On the south side, the topography is more gentle. No perennial surface streams flow into or out of the lake, and it is presumed that surface seepage occurs in the volcanic terrain. Although there are no developed campgrounds, there are a number of beautiful, rustic sites. Eastern brook trout are stocked annually and fishing is reported to be quite good, both from shore and from small rafts on the open water.</p>
<p>The lake basin consists of a single, deep (90 feet) basin scoured out during the Pleistocene by glacial action. Relatively shallow (less than 10 feet) bays are present at both east and west ends of the lake. Water quality is excellent, being extremely low in chemical constituents; major ion concentrations, alkalinity, and conductivity are among the lowest of Oregon lakes. Phosphorus and chlorophyl concentrations are very low, and the water is exceptionally transparent. Doris Lake is a marvelous example of a pristine mountain lake; it is ultraoligotrophic, and biological productivity is very low.</p>

"Roslyn Lake","256","<p>Roslyn Lake was a historic reservoir built by Portland General Electric for the Bull Run Hydroelectric Project. &nbsp;The dam that formed the lake was removed in 2008 as part of the decommissioning of the hydroelectric project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Roslyn Lake is an artificial lake built by Portland General Electric as a storage reservoir for the Bull Run power plant. Primary inflow is diverted from the Sandy River from a point about five miles upstream and carried to the lake by tunnel and flume. Excess water from Portland's Bull Run water supply is also periodically diverted into the lake. Water is released through an outlet structure into the power house, and discharged from there into the Sandy River. The lake was formed by the construction of a stone and earth dike almost entirely around it, so that the water level is in most places above the level of the surrounding countryside. Years ago, before the power canal was screened, trout and steelhead came into the lake, and many were caught as there was no way out for the fish. Fish can no longer come into the lake, but rainbow trout are stocked by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. Best angling is reported to be on the east side where the inflow is located. No motorboats are allowed on the lake. A P.G.E. recreational area along the southeast side of the lake has excellent picnic facilities and is used frequently by visitors from the Portland metropolitan area.</p>
<p>The ecological characteristics of Roslyn Lake are influenced by two factors -- its shallow depth and the inflow from the Bull Run and Sandy Rivers. Wave action stirring the sediments, in addition to contributing nutrients to the lake, causes the water to become muddy at times. The very transparent, low-nutrient inflow tends to counteract these effects by diluting the lake water and thereby lowering suspended particulate and nutrient concentrations. Secchi disk measurements indicate highly mesotrophic conditions. Chlorophyl, phosphorus, and major ion concentrations are moderate, and also indicate mesotrophic conditions for Roslyn Lake. The bottom of the lake consists of mud and sand, and supports several species of macrophytes (<em>Elodea canadensis</em>, <em>Myriophyllum exalbescens</em>, <em>Lemna minor</em>, and others).</p>

"Chickahominy Reservoir","166","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Chickahominy Reservoir (also known as Clusters Lake) was created during 1951 and 1952 by the construction of a dam on Chickahominy Creek. It was built with private funds to provide storage of irrigation water for the Silver Creek Ranch. However, as of 1970 the reservoir had never filled to capacity and it proved to be inadequate for its intended purpose. It has since been obtained by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife for sport fishing, and has developed into one of the best fisheries in southeastern Oregon. The reservoir had received its first plant of fish in 1957, a load of Kamloops trout, which prospered in spite of competition for food with an abundant population of rough fish. Despite a series of treatments, the rough fish were not eliminated until the reservoir dried up completely in 1968, and no trash fish have been recorded since that time. In recent years stocking has been primarily fingerling rainbow trout, and fish as large as 32 inches have been caught. The reservoir is open all year and winter ice fishing has been good. In 1981 there were 73,175 visitor days, of which 24,880 were for fishing only. Land ownership around the reservoir is almost totally private, with the exception of about 40 acres near the dam which are administered by the Bureau of Land Management; recreational facilities and a boat launch are provided by the B.L.M. The drainage basin is a semi-arid rangeland covered by sagebrush, with sparse stands of junipers at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Morphometrically, the reservoir is shallow with a maximum depth at full pool of only 28 feet. Bottom material is composed primarily of silt, lava rock, and detritus from decaying vegetation. The concentrations of ions are above average for Oregon lakes, because of the arid climate of the area. During summer, surface water pH rises and sometimes exceeds 8.5. During mid to late summer surface water temperatures become quite warm. There is some growth of macrophytes in the shallow areas, and the reservoir contains some submerged and decaying sagebrush. Frequent blooms of planktonic algae occur during the summer, including species of blue-green algae, and there are reports of occasional winter fish kills owing to oxygen depletion after the die off of the planktonic algae and submerged macrophytes. The reservoir is in fact quite eutrophic, with high phosphorus concentration and limited water transparency.</p>

"Suttle Lake","124","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Suttle Lake is a very well known and heavily used lake on the east slope of the Cascade Range. It is easily seen by all travellers along U.S. Highway 20 about five miles east of Santiam Pass. The name Suttle is in honor of John Settle, one of the principals in the supervision and construction of the Willamette Valley and Cascade Mountain Military Wagon Road in the 1860s. It is said that while on the expedition Settle went hunting and found the lake which was named for him (although misspelled); he also found nearby Blue Lake.</p>
<p>Suttle Lake owes its existence to glaciation as do so many of the lakes in the Cascade Range. The valley of Lake Creek which contains the lake basin, is broad and easily recognizable as a glacial trough, sculpted during the Pleistocene Epoch when all the high mountain areas in Oregon were buried by ice. Terminal and lateral moraines impounded the headwater portions of Lake Creek. The shape of Suttle Lake reflects this origin; it is long and narrow, conforming to the symmetry of the glacial valley, and consists of a single deep basin with relatively steep sides. Much of the lake is deeper than 60 feet, yet the deepest point is only about 75 feet. This type of morphometry can be seen in other Oregon lakes formed by the impoundment of waters in glacial troughs. Odell is a good example in the Cascades, and Wallowa Lake in northeast Oregon is another dramatic example. Blue Lake, immediately up valley from Suttle Lake, was formed by volcanic activity in more recent geologic times.</p>
<p>The drainage basin of Suttle Lake is a densely forested region of steep slopes. Permeable volcanic rocks cover much of the basin and permit a substantial amount of ground water movement. Thus, a major source of water to the lake is subsurface seepage. The only permanent surface inflow to the lake is Link Creek from Blue Lake. A few small intermittent streams also contribute flow during the snowmelt season. Lake Creek, the outlet, eventually joins the Metolius River after flowing north through the Camp Sherman area. The shoreline of the lake is federal land and there are a number of Forest Service campgrounds and boat launching sites. This is an extremely popular outdoor recreation area in all seasons of the year. A hiking trail circles the lake and other trails head off to other small lakes in the area. A large private resort is located at the east end of the lake on land leased from the Forest Service, while Suttle Lake Lodge at the north end provides supplies and cabins. There are several other private resorts in the Suttle Lake-Blue Lake area, as well as a number of church camps. All sorts of water recreation opportunities exist: fishing, swimming, camping, picnicking, water-skiing and small boating. Fishing centers on kokanee, or land-locked blueback salmon, taken most successfully early in the season. Rainbow trout and brown trout are also taken, but in smaller numbers. Rainbow trout are stocked regularly by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. One end of Suttle Lake has a 10 mph speed limit for boats.</p>
<p>The bottom of Suttle Lake is composed of sand, gravel, and in deeper areas, muck. Most of the littoral areas are gravel and rock. Macrophytes are found along the periphery in a narrow zone between the 6 and 20 foot depths. However, they are not a problem and most of the lake is far too deep for macrophyte growth. The major ion chemistry is unexceptional, but the concentration of phosphorus is much higher than might be anticipated and promotes the active growth of planktonic algae, sometimes to bloom proportions. The lake has a history of algal blooms; Newcomb'(1941) reported a high abundance of phytoplankton. In general, high densities of diatoms occur throughout the year, but in summer and early fall the lake also has high densities of blue-green algae. In spring <em>Asterionella formosa</em> predominates; summer algae are mostly <em>Fragilaria crotonesis</em> and <em>Anabaena</em> species; in the fall, Stephanodiscus astrea is most common. In their 1978 study of Suttle Lake, the U.S. Ei T2 nmental Protection Agency in the National Eutrophication Survey reported <em>Melosira</em>, <em>Dactylococcopsis, Anabaena, Stephanodiscus, Fragilaria, Chroomonas</em>, and <em>Cryptomonas</em> as predominant algal species (E.P.A. 1978). Transparency of the water is reasonably good, but it may have been reduced somewhat in recent decades due to cultural activities in the area. Newcomb (1941) measured a Secchi disk depth of 35 feet (10.6 meters) in 1940; several studies in the early 1970s report values ranging from 14 to 16 feet (4.3 to 5.0 meters); and measurements in 1982 in this survey were 22 feet (6.7 meters) or lower. Although not conclusive, these limited data suggest a decline in water transparency concurrent with increased recreational use in recent decades.</p>
<p>The various indicators of trophic status are contradictory. Secchi disk measurements clearly suggest mesotrophic conditions, whereas the standing crop of algae clearly indicate eutrophic conditions. Other Cascade lakes also exhibit this apparent contradiction between water transparency and density of phytoplankton; for example, Odell Lake, Diamond Lake and Marion Lake. All four of these lakes have two attributes in common: (1) high phosphorus concentration, and (2) similar physiographic location, geologic origin, and morphometry. It may be that the long mountain winters limit biological productivity for most of the year; but during the short summer growing season, high phosphorus levels drive the lakes to a higher than expected trophic state. The blue-green algae which occur in the lake (<em>Anabaena spp</em>) are capable of nitrogen fixation. Bioassays (E.P.A. 1978) indicate that nitrogen limits algal growth in the lake, a reflection of the generous phosphorus supply. The source of the high phosphorus levels is debatable. It is certainly due in part to natural sources; however, the fact that the trophic state has increased in recent decades suggests contributions from the increased level of human activity around and on the lake (McHugh 1972). If this is so, the trend is likely to continue. The source(s) of the high nutrient levels should be determined and if cultural activities are responsible, the feasibility of various lake manipulations should be considered. A D.E.Q. study found high phosphate levels in Blue Lake close to its outlet, and the E.P.A. (1978) credited this outlet stream with 81.9 percent of the total phosphorus input. If the phosphate source can be located and eliminated, Suttle Lake should be a very good candidate for phosphorus inactivation (McHugh 1979). In summary, Suttle Lake would be classified as mesotrophic according to transparency data; however, the abundance of phosphorus and algae appear to be the overriding consideration and the lake is classified as eutrophic.</p>

"Laurance Lake","217","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Laurance Lake (also known as Clear Branch Reservoir) is a fairly new irrigation reservoir on the Clear Branch of the Middle Fork of Hood River. It lies in a heavily forested valley with steep ridges on both sides; Mt. Hood looms dramatically to the south. The lake and its drainage base are entirely on National Forest land. The impoundment was built by the Middle Fork Irrigation District, a company formed early in the century to solve the irrigation needs of farmers in the upper Hood River Valley. Until the 1960s the normal mode of supplying water in the valley was by rill and flood irrigation. It became obvious that excessive erosion was occurring, and it was not long before application of water by sprinklers was the way of farming. With the sprinklers came the need to supply a reliable source of clean water. Laurance Lake, impounded by the 109-foot high Clear Creek Dam, is the source of this clean water. Funds for the project were borrowed from the Farmers Home Administration, with matching grant funds and technical assistance provided by the Soil Conservation Service. Nearly 8000 acres in the upper Hood River Valley are now irrigated through an underground gravity pressure system.</p>
<p>Recreational use of the lake is important to local residents. Fishing, in particular, is popular both from the shore and on the water, and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has used the lake for experimental steelhead rearing. A picnic ground and boat launch site are maintained by the Forest Service on the south shoreline. Use of motors on boats is prohibited.</p>
<p>Laurance Lake has an elongated shape, conforming to the contours of the glacial valley in which it lies. At full pool it is over 150 feet deep behind the dam. Most of the area of shallow water is confined to the western end where Clear Branch Creek (the largest tributary) enters the lake. Full pool is maintained from early spring through early summer, and the water level is gradually lowered during late summer to supply irrigation water to the Hood River Valley. Water chemistry is typical of Cascade lakes and reservoirs. The water is generally quite transparent, although the shallow area near the boat ramp at the southeastern corner of the lake sometimes becomes turbid with suspended bottom sediment. Chlorophyl concentration is moderate and only a small amount of submerged macrophytes develop in the lake. Laurance Lake is, by all indications, mesotrophic.</p>

"Lower Eddeeleo Lake","227","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Lower Eddeeleo Lake is the largest in a string of remote, back-country lakes that extend northwest of Waldo Lake in the Central Oregon Cascade Mountains. The glacial basin in which these lakes are found is part of the Waldo Lake Recreation Area, a ten square mile region administered by the Willamette National Forest. Given this designation, Lower Eddeeleo and surrounding lakes will continue to be undeveloped and should retain their primitive nature. The lake is named for Ed Clark, Dee Wright, and Leo McMahon, three former U.S. Forest Service employees who used to stock fish in these lakes by packhorse. Upper Eddeeleo Lake does not receive particularly heavy use by fishermen, although it reportedly offers excellent angling for both brook and rainbow trout. The lake is stocked each year and does have some native trout. No improved camp sites are located at the lake, but there are several pleasant, undeveloped ones.</p>
<p>Dense stands of conifer characterize the fairly gentle slopes around Lower Eddeeleo Lake, and a thick forest crowds the entire shoreline. Steady surface inflow from a small, unnamed stream is maintained by Lake Chetlo and Upper Eddeeleo Lake, which are about one-half mile south of Lower Eddeeleo Lake. The outflow stream, also unnamed, is tributary to the North Fork of the Middle Fork of the Willamette River.</p>
<p>Water quality in Lower Eddeeleo Lake is exceptionally good and the lake is classified as ultraoligotrophic. Surface water temperatures remain cool and the lake develops a distinct temperature stratification. Concentrations of major ions are very low as are the concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyl. Further, water transparency is very high (Secchi disk depth = 40 feet; 12.2 meters) and dissolved oxygen is near saturation at all depths.</p>

"Timothy Lake","132","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Timothy Lake is an artificial lake that was formed when Portland General Electric dammed the Oak Grove Fork of the Clackamas River in 1956 for the generation of hydroelectric power. The resulting impoundment flooded Timothy Meadows, an area that for many years had been a favorite of sheepherders for summer grazing. The name of the meadow was derived from their practice of spreading Timothy grass seed to supplement the natural grasses. The reservoir project was many years in making. In 1911, permits to build power generation facilities near the present dam site (and at several other locations on the Clackamas River) were issued to the Southern Pacific Railroad in anticipation of electrifying their lines in the Willamette Valley. These rights were soon purchased by P.G.E. However, due to the rough terrain and lack of access roads in the area, only preliminary surveys for development were made prior to 1953. In that year the Federal Power Commission approved the P.G.E. plan to dam the river to provide a reserve of water to increase the power generation capabilities of hydroplants situated farther downstream on the Clackamas. Timber was cleared from the site, service roads were constructed, and the dam was completed in January 1956. It is an earthfill structure, 110 feet in height and 740 feet long. The shape of the basin is more circular than is common for reservoirs, as it gives the appearance of a natural lake when full. At full pool Timothy Lake has a surface area of nearly 1300 acres and holds over 57,000 acre-feet of water.</p>
<p>Sheepherders no longer use the site of Timothy Meadows, but the lake has become the destination for a great number of recreationists. Access is by paved roads, and there are five Forest Service campgrounds along the shoreline. One of these, Meditation Point, is a wilderness campsite on the northwest side of the lake that can be reached only by boat or foot trail. Excellent boat launching facilities are also available, but there is a 10 mph speed limit for boats. Timothy Lake is a popular fishing lake, perhaps more because of its aesthetic appeal rather than for being a good producer. Rainbow trout and cutthroat trout are stocked regularly, and there is sufficient biological productivity in the lake to support a natural reproduction of kokanee and brook trout. Early season fishing is generally slow, and the lake produces best in the summer and fall. Fly angling near the mouths of the tributaries is excellent in late season. Although Timothy Lake is a reservoir, there are no irrigation withdrawals and fluctuations in water level are small compared to those undergone by most reservoirs. Thus, it is available for recreation throughout the year, except when access is blocked by snow. Heavy use has led to management and environmental problems at the lake: overuse and overcrowding, forest fires from campfires, law enforcement problems, destruction of vegetation, and erosion from overuse. Forest Service management practices are designed to control erosion and to rehabilitate overused areas.</p>
<p>The 52 square mile drainage basin to Timothy Lake is volcanic terrain of moderate relief. It is covered with a thick coniferous forest, although there are a number of large clear-cut areas that have been reseeded with Douglas fir. Land is also leased to ranchers for cattle and sheep grazing. A few small lakes are within the drainage basin, including Little Crater Lake, a geologic curiosity formed by the force of an artesian spring washing away the overlying siltstone.</p>
<p>The concentrations of major ions in Timothy Lake are average for reservoirs in the Willamette drainage basin. The concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyl and the water transparency indicate that the lake is mesotrophic. The species of phytoplankton observed in the lake are predominantly diatoms characteristic of mesotrophic lakes (<em>Asterionella, Fragilaria, </em>and <em>Synedra</em>); the chrysophyte <em>Dinobryon</em> is also common. Macrophytes are scarce. The lake develops a distinct thermal stratification during summer months, but is usually well oxygenated throughout the year, although periods of oxygen depletion have been observed. The bottom of the lake is covered with sunken logs and branches left from the construction period, and their decay may contribute to occasional oxygen depletion in the bottom water. These logs probably also contribute to the abundance of crayfish (""crawdads"") that occur in the lake by providing a suitable habitat for these crustaceans. It is not unusual for reservoirs to be more productive for several years after flooding than they are in later years, when nutrients from submerged soils and organic debris have been used up or sealed off by silt. Timothy Lake may yet experience this transition. There is no evidence that nutrients are entering the lake from camp areas (McHugh 1972), and there is a good flow-through of water all year. Human activity has apparently little influence on water quality.</p>

"Elk Lake (192)","192","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Elk Lake in western Oregon is considerably smaller than its namesake near Bend, but even at 64 acres it is the largest natural lake in this portion of the western Cascades. The footprint shaped waterbody lies in a U-shaped, glaciated valley at the base of Battle Ax Mountain. Well preserved moraines further identify the influence of glaciers in sculpting the region. One of these moraines formed a natural dam that impounded the water draining from the bowl-shaped upper end of the valley to form the lake. One small, unnamed surface stream now feeds the lake, the main source of water being seepage through the volcanic terrain. Elk Lake is the source of Elk Lake Creek, a tributary of the Collawash River, in turn a major tributary of the Clackamas River.</p>
<p>Elk Lake is not as heavily used for recreation as might be expected, primarily because of difficult access. It cannot be reached by road from the Clackamas River area and the access from Highway 22 includes six steep miles on a rough gravel road. This road is generally closed until late June because of snow. Nevertheless, those who do visit the lake find good fishing. Small rainbow trout are stocked and taken readily; kokanee have also been reported. Fly fishing is particularly good in August and September. A Forest Service campground is maintained at the west end and is commonly used as a base camp for hikes into the back-country, the Pansy Lakes Basin for example. Although Elk Lake lies in the extreme southern end of Mt. Hood National Forest, administrative duties are handled by the Willamette National Forest out of convenience.</p>
<p>The lake has a single deep basin slightly northeast of center, but much of it is shallower than 10 feet, particularly at the upper and lower ends. Nevertheless, only a minor amount of rooted macrophytes has developed, their growth perhaps limited by the cool temperatures at this elevation. The water column develops a slight thermal stratification, with a thermocline at about 15 to 25 feet (4.6 to 7.6 meters). Major ion concentrations are very low, characteristic of Oregon mountain lakes. All water quality conditions indicate that Elk Lake is unproductive and pristine. Chlorophyl and phosphorus concentrations are very low, water transparency is sufficient that the bottom of the lake can be seen (maximum 30 feet), and the lake is saturated with oxygen at all depths. These are all characteristics of an oligotrophic lake.</p>

"Agate Reservoir","146","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Agate Lake is an irrigation reservoir built by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1966 and managed as a component of the Talent Division of the Rogue River Basin Project, a multipurpose water resource development with emphasis on irrigation. The reservoir was formed by a 77-foot high earthfill, rock-faced dam which impounds the waters of Dry Creek. Inflow to Agate Lake also comes via a canal from Yankee Reservoir. Outflow is into Dry Creek and ultimately into irrigation canals for use downstream. The Medford Irrigation District Canal passes through the Agate Lake drainage basin, carrying water from Fish Lake to the Medford area. Agate Lake is named for the nearby Agate Desert, famous for its abundance of minerals and for its beautiful spring display of wildflowers.</p>
<p>The drainage basin of Agate Lake is mostly private land with some small parcels of Natural Resource Lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Agate Lake Recreation Area, a county park, surrounds the lake, so the shoreline is entirely under public management. Recreational use of the lake is primarily by fishermen and the water is fished heavily, despite a ban on motorboats. Small electric motors are permitted. Fishing is best in the spring; bluegills are abundant and crappies and largemouth bass are also present.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Concentrations of major ions in the water are above average for reservoirs in Oregon, but similar to others in the Rogue River Valley. Above average concentrations of calcium and magnesium indicate the influence of leaching from the soils by irrigation in the drainage basin. Water quality data indicate that Agate Lake is one of the more eutrophic lakes in Oregon. Total phosphorus and chlorophyl concentrations are high and water transparency is limited. Blooms of phytoplankton occur during the summer months and Anabaena spiroides, a blue-green algae found in enriched waters, was the dominant species on the sample date of 7/14/82. Other associated indicators of eutrophic conditions are the fact that oxygen is sometimes depleted in the deeper water, biological productivity is high, and the lake is overpopulated with rough fish.&nbsp;</p>

"Drews Reservoir","189","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Drews Reservoir is a large irrigation impoundment in the Drews Valley of south-central Oregon. The reservoir was formed in 1911 with the damming of Drews Creek about nine miles northwest of Goose Lake, its purpose being to distribute flows more evenly during the latter part of the growing season in July and August. The stream, the valley, and in turn the reservoir were named for Lieutenant-Colonel C. S. Drew, in command of the Owyhee Reconnaissance of the First Oregon Cavalry in 1864. The drainage basin above the dam is 174 square miles of forest and rangeland, much of it within the Fremont National Forest. The land around the reservoir and in the valley upstream is, for the most part, in private ownership. In addition to Drews Creek there are a number of small, intermittent streams that contribute water to the reservoir. Largest of these is Dog Creek, originating in Dog Lake four miles upstream. The outflow is diverted into the North Drews Canal which has been carrying water to irrigated lands west of Lakeview since March 1914.</p>
<p>Fishing at Drews Reservoir has been quite good for rainbow trout and a variety of warm-water species. In an attempt to enhance the fishery, white crappie were introduced in 1975, and channel catfish in 1978. Impediments to fishing are the low water levels in late summer necessitated by irrigation withdrawals and an abundance of rough fish. Visitor facilities include picnic tables, restrooms, and a boat ramp on the southwest side near the dam.</p>
<p>The water quality characteristics of Drews Reservoir are largely influenced by the high concentration of suspended inorganic sediment. Although the reservoir is not very shallow (average depth = 15.9 feet), wind-driven waves nonetheless stir bottom sediments and decrease water transparency (Secchi disk depth = 2.3 feet, or 0.7 meters). The total phosphorus concentration is quite high (0.17 mg/1), and most of it is probably derived from the bottom sediments. Phytoplankton are fairly abundant; McHugh (1972) reported a spring diatom bloom of <em>Synedra ulna</em>, followed in the summer by a bloom of <em>Aphanizomenon flos-aquae</em>. One side of the reservoir is shallow, and despite the water level fluctuations macrophytes are common here. The reservoir is distinctly eutrophic.</p>

"Badger Lake","152","<p>
<p>(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Badger Lake lies in the extreme northwest corner of the Deschutes River Basin about eight miles southeast of Mt. Hood. It originated as a small glacial cirque lake situated in the upper end of the steep Badger Creek canyon, carved out during the period of intense Pleistocene glaciation. Approximately 30 years ago, the lake was artificially enlarged by the construction of two earthfill dams to provide additional water for downstream irrigation in drier lands outside the National Forest boundary. Consequently, there is a large draw-down during late summer when irrigation demands are high. Several small, intermittent streams flow from the small, rugged drainage basin into the lake. Outflow occurs through a flume into Badger Creek about 200 feet downstream from the dam, until minimum pool is reached (usually by the end of September) and no further releases are made. The amphitheater-shaped drainage basin is heavily forested with grand fir, mountain hemlock, silver fir, and Engelmann spruce. Douglas fir is dominant in some areas due to past fire occurrence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Badger Lake can be reached by a rough 10 mile Forest Service road, but it is more appealing as a hike-in lake, reached either by Gumjuwac Trail from Oregon Highway 35 or from Bonney Crossing Campground on the Badger Creek Trail. It is considered to be a good rainbow trout lake and is stocked annually; fly-fishing is best during the fall when the fish are larger. A pleasant Forest Service campground is maintained at the lake. The Badger Creek Roadless Area is currently under consideration for wilderness classification. If it is so classified, road access will be eliminated entirely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lake is elongate in shape, with shallow areas at each end; however, the bottom slopes steeply along the northwest and southeast shoreline. There is no growth of submerged macrophytes. The concentrations of major ions in the water are about average for lakes in the Cascades. Total phosphorus and chlorophyl concentrations are low, and water transparency is good. The bottom of the lake consists primarily of gravel with some boulders. The lack of organic sediment and the water chemistry indicate that Badger Lake is distinctly oligotrophic. The coarse sediment prevents any significant resuspension of bottom material that might otherwise be expected in a lake with water level fluctuations due to artificial withdrawals.&nbsp;</p>

"Olive Lake","248","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Olive Lake, originally a small natural lake in the headwaters of the North Fork of the John Day River, was enlarged early in this century by the construction of a 35-foot high dam on the Lake Creek outlet. The primary reason for increasing storage was to provide water for power generation. A pipeline diverts outflow to the Fremont Powerhouse, an old power plant which was built during the gold mining days in the Blue Mountains. Upper Reservoir, above Olive Lake, was constructed simultaneously with the dam at Olive Lake. Although these reservoirs were built to store water for power plant use, there have since been demands placed on the water for irrigation purposes.</p>
<p>The drainage basin for Olive Lake is 4.2 square miles of forest land within the Umatilla National Forest. A nice forest campground is at the north end of the lake near the outlet, and boats can be launched. Because of irrigation withdrawals, the water level fluctuates and sometimes restricts recreational use. A variety of fish species are found in the lake; rainbow trout and brook trout make up most of the catch and there are also lots of kokanee, or land-locked salmon. Unfortunately, there has been a minor problem with rough fish in the lake in past years.</p>
<p>Water in Olive Lake is low in mineral constituents; major ions, alkalinity, and conductivity are well below average for reservoirs in this part of the state. The concentration of phosphorus is low and water transparency is excellent, both suggesting oligotrophic to mesotrophic conditions. However, other characteristics of Olive Lake indicate that it is mesotrophic. There is some evidence of oxygen depletion below the thermocline, and an oxygen surplus within the relatively shallow thermocline. Surplus oxygen in the thermocline, known technically as a ""positive heterograph oxygen curve,"" generally results from active primary production. The concentration of chlorophyl also suggests mesotrophic conditions, as does the excellent growth of kokanee, rainbow trout, and brook trout.</p>

"Coffenbury Lake","171","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Coffenbury Lake is a long, narrow and shallow water body located in the northern Clatsop Plains about one-half mile from the Pacific Ocean. It is a typical coastal interdune lake situated between parallel relict dunes that trend north and south. There are no inflowing or outflowing streams, and the lake level fluctuates with seasonal changes in the water table, from about 16 feet above mean sea level in the fall to about 22 feet in the early spring. The surrounding area consists of well-drained, sandy soils which support a dense forest of spruce and fir and deciduous species such as willow, crabapple and alder.</p>
<p>Located in Fort Stevens State Park, Coffenbury Lake is very popular as a family recreation site for boating, swimming and fishing. Cutthroat and rainbow trout, yellow perch, and catfish are taken by anglers; nevertheless the lake does not have the reputation of being a particularly good producer. A boat launch is located at the north end of the lake and a 10 mph speed limit is in effect. Although there is no camping at the lake itself, a large state park campground nearby is one of the most heavily used in the state. Two bathhouses serve the needs of swimmers at beaches on the east and northwest shoreline.</p>
<p>Coffenbury Lake is exposed to the prevailing flow of marine air and does not stratify. Sodium and cloride concentrations and the conductivity are slightly above average for coastal lakes in Oregon, reflecting proximity to the ocean. The water is moderately stained with organic matter derived from swampy portions of the drainage basin. This moderate nutrient enrichment is also due to the presence of humic materials leached from the peaty material on part of the lake bottom.</p>
<p>Beds of water lilies and other macrophytes stand along the shoreline, but are less extensive than might be expected for such a shallow lake. Reduced water transparency (6.0 feet; 1.8 meters) is probably responsible for this fact. In contrast, Coffenbury Lake has shown a diversity of plankton along its length which is quite unusual for a lake this small. This diversity may be related to the type of bottom sediments. For example, it was observed in 1969 that <em>Anabaena circinalis</em> was the dominant form in the sandy north end, but was not observed in the muddy, peaty south end where <em>Anacystis aerugmosa</em> and <em>Melosira granulata</em> were co-dominant. The combination of these chemical and biological factors allows Coffenbury Lake to be classified as mesotrophic, although it is very close to eutrophic.</p>

"Little Cultus Lake","221","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Little Cultus Lake is one of the many beautiful mountain lakes on the east slope of the Cascades which are accessible from the popular Cascade Lakes Highway. The lake can be reached by a gravel road from the highway or by trail south from Cultus Lake. The word Cultus is a Chinook jargon word meaning bad or worthless. It has been used in many places in the Pacific Northwest, generally by pioneers who lacked one or more of the essentials -- wood, water, and grass. However, there seems to be no specific reason for its application to either Cultus or Little Cultus Lake.</p>
<p>Little Cultus lies in an elongated basin in a glacial-scoured valley, and is oriented on an east-west axis. Nearly half the lake is shallower than 10 feet; but the maximum depth, located near the western end, is over 50 feet. Several unnamed streams provide inflow to the lake; the outlet is Deer Creek which flows into Crane Prairie Reservoir, a Bureau of Reclamation storage facility. A dense coniferous forest covers the landscape in the drainage basin and the dominant feature is Cultus Mountain, a symmetrical volcanic cone rising abruptly on the north side of the lake. A quiet Forest Service campground is located on the south side of the lake and a 10 mph speed limit for boats is enforced. Fishing in Little Cultus Lake is fair for brook trout and a few rainbow trout, although it is not as good as in Cultus Lake.</p>
<p>Concentrations of ions in the water are low, but noticeably higher than in Cultus Lake. The concentrations of chlorophyl and phosphorus are moderate, and water transparency is average. Little Cultus Lake is oligotrophic, tending to mesotrophic, in contrast to ultraoligotrophic Cultus Lake.</p>

"Pine Hollow Reservoir","251","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Pine Hollow Reservoir is a relatively new impoundment on the east slope of the northern Oregon Cascades, built in the 1960s for the dual purposes of irrigation and recreation. A 65-foot high earthfill dam impounds the waters of Threemile Creek and Pine Hollow Creek and provides storage for about 4800 acre feet of water at a maximum surface area of 228 acres. Construction of the reservoir was the result of a cooperative agreement between the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and the local irrigation district, and the stored water is an important contribution to agricultural activity in the Prineville area.</p>
<p>Because of the network of irrigation ditches in the area, inflow of water from the natural drainage basin accounts for only a small portion of the water in the reservoir. Surrounding land is used primarily for agriculture in the lower reaches of the drainage basin while the upper reaches consist of forested slopes in the Mt. Hood National Forest. The reservoir itself lies on private land just east of the Mt. Hood National Forest boundary. However, public access is permitted from most of the shoreline. According to agreement between the parties that built the reservoir, it is not drained dry each fall as are many of the other small irrigation impoundments in Central and Eastern Oregon. Thus fish are able to survive from year to year; rainbow trout are stocked and provide good angling. There are no visitor services at the reservoir.</p>
<p>The concentrations of ions in the water are surprisingly low for a water body in this semi-arid environment where agriculture is an important land use in the drainage basin. The reservoir is not deep (21 feet mean depth) but does develop a noticeable temperature stratification during the summer. The concentration of phosphorus is moderate, and water transparency is limited. The reservoir is mesotrophic in character.</p>

"Olalla Reservoir","247","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Olalla Reservoir is owned and operated by the Georgia-Pacific Corporation who built it in 1957 to supply water for their paper processing mill in Toledo four miles to the south. The reservoir was created by construction of a small earth-fill dam which impounds the waters of the West Branch of Olalla Creek. The hydrology of the reservoir is unusual in that the principal inflow is through a pipe which diverts water from the nearby Siletz River. Only a small amount of natural inflow is derived from West Olalla Creek and two other small streams. The shape of the reservoir is dendritic or branching, typical of impoundments in stream valleys, whether natural or artificial. The term Olalla is a modification of Olathe, the original spelling of the creek name. It is a Chinook jargon word which means berries in general, or salmonberries, and is a word used for a variety of features around Oregon.</p>
<p>The shoreline of Olalla Reservoir and much of the surrounding landscape is owned by the Georgia Pacific Corporation and managed as commercial timberland. Vegetation is predominantly second-growth Douglas fir.Deeply weathered siltstone and sandstone slopes aremoderately steep around the reservoir, but elevations of the surrounding ridges are not great. Public access to the water is permitted by Georgia-Pacific and small boats without motors may be launched. Rainbow and cutthroat trout are stocked by the state and anglers are often quite successful. A company-owned campground immediately downstream from the dam is maintained for public use.</p>
<p>Olalla Reservoir reaches a maximum depth of about 65 feet directly behind the dam at full pool. The water develops a temperature stratification in the summer and oxygen is partially depleted in the deeper water. Mesotrophic conditions are indicated by the combination of the dissolved oxygen profile, water transparency, chlorophyl and total phosphorus concentrations.</p>

"Triangle Lake","134","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Triangle Lake lies high in the Oregon Coast Range only a few miles west of the divide and in the headwater portion of the Siuslaw River. The name of the lake is obviously taken from its geometric shape; however, in the latter part of the nineteenth century it was variously known as Loon Lake, Echo Lake, and Lake of the Woods. Although there are hundreds of natural lakes on the Oregon Coast, there are very few in the Coast Range. The explanation lies with the geologic and climatic history of the area. The Pleistocene Epoch was a time of high precipitation and this fact combined with tectonic uplift of the mountains produced very steep-walled, narrow valleys throughout the range. Glacial and volcanic processes, responsible for most of the Cascade Mountain lakes, were virtually non-existent in the Coast Range. However, landslides in the rugged topography are quite common, and the few natural lakes that do exist were formed where massive slides blocked a river valley, impounding water behind it. The only two large natural lakes in the Coast Range, Triangle Lake and Loon Lake, were formed in this manner. Baldwin (1976) described the formation of Triangle Lake. It was blocked by a tilted mass of sandstone that evidently came from high on the north slope of the valley drained by Lake Creek. The creek found its outlet against the south wall where it is incised in bedrock rather than in the slide material. This condition will insure the long life of the alluvial valley but not necessarily of Triangle Lake which is only a remnant of a long lake that used to extend several miles upstream. Most of the old lake has been filled in by sediment and the size of the lake is also slowly reduced as erosion of the outlet reduces the water level. The depth of the water is 97 feet at its deepest point, which is along the western edge where the outlet occurs. However, this is much less than the original depth, and the volume of alluvium necessary to fill the basin is only a small fraction of that already deposited.</p>
<p>The 54 square mile drainage basin is an area of steep, timbered slopes; it reaches a maximum elevation of 3550 feet at Prairie Mountain. Much of the land is owned privately and sections of it are federal land administered by the Bureau of Land Management. The entire shoreline of the lake, other than a small county park, is entirely in private ownership. However, public access is not a problem and Triangle Lake has long been a popular site for water-based recreation for local residents and for visitors from the Willamette Valley. Heaviest use is for water skiing and swimming in the summer. Anglers take warm water species in good numbers throughout the spring and summer. Bluegill are most numerous, followed by catfish, perch, and largemouth bass. Cutthroat trout and rainbow trout are also taken early in the spring; the cutthroat are native and the rainbow trout are stocked.</p>
<p>Sixty to seventy private homes are located along the shoreline, many of them summer homes. Several private resorts and other businesses are also located on or near the shoreline adjacent to Oregon Highway 36. Many of these structures near the lake are old, and there is very little modern development. Most of the homes are constructed on the very edge of the lake, with no room for an adequate drainfield. Some houses do not even use septic tanks, and earth-pit privies have been installed within a few feet of the lake. Despite this, the bacteriological quality of the lake water is fairly good. However, a 1970 survey by the Oregon State Board of Health recommended that future sewage disposal facilities be located on the side of Highway 36 away from the lake. Because of this level of human activity adjacent to the lake, the water is enriched and supports algal blooms. McHugh (1972) reported blooms of <em>Asterionella formosa, Fragilaria crotonensis, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae,</em> and <em>Ceratium hirundinella</em>. Phinney and McLachlan (1956) reported a bloom of <em>Gloeotrichia enchinulata </em>in August 1956. The phytoplankton density observed on 5/13/82 in this survey was low, probably limited by cooler water temperatures.</p>
<p>Water in Triangle Lake is very dilute and has conductivity lower than any of the coastal lakes. Of course, Triangle Lake is considerably higher and is 28 miles from the ocean. Because most of the lake is relatively deep (average depth is 52 feet), there is little growth of rooted macrophytes. However, in the shallow areas, macrophytes are quite abundant; for example, near the outlet and in the other littoral areas. In spite of the development around the lake and some agricultural activity in the drainage basin, both of which may contribute nutrients to the lake, the concentrations of chlorophyl and phosphorus are below average and the water transparency is above average for lakes of the region. The lake is deep enough to develop a pronounced thermal stratification in the summer and shows some tendency for oxygen depletion in the deeper water (Smith and Bella 1973). Maloney et al (1975) conducted nutrient bioassays (in the laboratory) and found that the addition of various nutrients did not increase algal growth. In nutrient bioassays conducted within the lake by Powers et al (1975), contradictory results were obtained in that phosphorus stimulated growth. The combination of chemical and biological indicators suggest a mesotrophic classification for Triangle Lake.</p>

"Haystack Reservoir","208","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Haystack Reservoir, located in the semi-arid rangeland of Central Oregon, was constructed in 1950 to store water for irrigation of agricultural lands in the Deschutes River Basin. It is a component of the Bureau of Reclamation's Deschutes Project which includes Wickiup Reservoir and Crane Prairie Reservoir. Flow from Haystack Creek is stored in the reservoir created by Haystack Dam. However, most of the stored water in the reservoir is supplied by feeder canals, and the impoundment provides for regulatory storage of the releases from Wickiup Reservoir.</p>
<p>The name Haystack was derived from nearby Haystack Butte; indeed, the territory around the base of this prominent landmark has long been known as ""Haystack Country."" An 80-foot high, earthfill dam impounds the intermittent flow in Haystack Draw, a tributary of the Crooked River Arm of Lake Billy Chinook; releases from the reservoir are diverted into a canal which leads to the North Unit Main Canal. Both the reservoir and its contributing drainage basin are within the boundaries of the Crooked River National Grassland, administered by the Ochoco National Forest. This is land that was mostly reclaimed from abandoned homesteads on which the natural ground cover had been depleted. Resources of the Grassland are managed on a multiple use-sustained yield basis with a goal of restoring and maintaining productivity.</p>
<p>Haystack Reservoir has developed into a popular recreation site. It has been heavily stocked with rainbow trout by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and provides a fairly successful angling experience; largemouth bass and crappies have also been stocked. Boats can be launched from several points on the shore and fishing from the bank is easy. A Forest Service campground is available for visitors as well as a private resort with boat rentals.</p>
<p>The reservoir is not drained seasonally as are many other small impoundments in the drier parts of the state. At full pool, the mean depth is 27 feet, and the maximum depth is 75 feet. The shoal area occurs unevenly around the shoreline; except for a shallow reef near the dam, most of the shallow water area is located around the northwest fringe of the reservoir and macrophytes grow there extensively. The concentrations of major ions are moderate in comparison with lakes throughout the state and somewhat lower than average for reservoirs in Central Oregon. The phosphorus concentration is high and water transparency is limited. Chlorophyl is also high and phytoplankton blooms are frequent. The phytoplankton includes species of blue-green algae which are sometimes conspicuous because they float near the surface. The reservoir is distinctly eutrophic.</p>

"Crane Prairie Reservoir","54","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Crane Prairie Reservoir is a large, shallow impoundment on the upper Deschutes River in Central Oregon. It is a component of the Deschutes Project, a Bureau of Reclamation project which includes Wickiup Dam and Reservoir, Haystack Dam and Reservoir, North Unit Main Canal and lateral system, and the Crooked River Pumping Plant. The Project furnishes a full supply of irrigation water for about 50,000 acres of land within the North Unit Irrigation District, and a supplemental supply for more than 47,000 acres in the Central Oregon Irrigation District and Crook County Improvement District. These irrigated lands are all in the vicinity of the town of Madras. Storage for the North Unit Irrigation District is provided by Wickiup Reservoir. Releases from the reservoir are diverted from the Deschutes River at North Canal Dam and carried to project lands by the North Unit Main Canal. Water stored in Crane Prairie Reservoir is also diverted by the North Canal Dam into delivery and distribution systems privately built and operated by the Central Oregon Irrigation District and Crook County Improvement District No. I. However, the existence of Crane Prairie Reservoir pre-dates the Reclamation project (Hatton 1980). A rock-filled dam was constructed in 1922 by several local irrigation districts serving lands in the Madras area, principally the Central Oregon Irrigation District. Waters backing up behind the dam flooded most of Crane Prairie and part of the adjacent forest, killing many trees. In order to recover marketable timber from the site, the reservoir was drained periodically. Leakage through the original dam made it unsafe and a new dam was built by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1939 and 1940. It is an earthfill structure 36 feet high and 285 feet long at the crest. The reservoir has a capacity of 55,300 acre-feet when full (U.S. Bureau of Reclamation 1983).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crane Prairie Reservoir is very shallow and irregularly shaped. It is fed primarily by the Deschutes River, but also by Snow Creek, the Cultus River, Cultus Creek, and Quinn Creek. These tributaries are short streams originating on the east slopes of the Cascades. Prior to flooding, the prairie was home for an abundance of cranes who fished the Deschutes for their food supply. The prairie and then the reservoir assumed the name of the bird. Today the landscape shows the results of flooding the meadow. Tall, bare stumps and limbs like grey ghosts rise from the lake (Hatton 1980). These snags provide nesting places for osprey, large birds that feed on fish in the shallow waters of the reservoir. Crane Prairie is the home of the largest nesting colony in the Pacific Northwest. It is also home to blue herons, cormorants, kingfishers, and many other species of birds. The Crane Prairie Osprey Management Area, covering 10,600 acres, was established in 1970 to preserve this special habitat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crane Prairie Reservoir is a very popular site for camping and fishing. Several good Forest Service campgrounds are located around the shoreline, accessible from a number of access roads, and there are several places from which to launch boats. Crane Prairie Resort on the east side rents boats and supplies. Fishing has generally been excellent for large trout, particularly rainbow trout and brook trout. Kokanee, stocked by the state in recent years, also provide good angling. Best fishing is in the three major river arms of the reservoir, where the large trout tend to remain in the summer. Fly fishing is particularly good in the shallow impoundment early in the season. Unfortunately, in recent years there has been a decline in the numbers of trout due to a combination of factors, including low water levels and an abundance of fish-eating cormorants. The extent to which these birds deplete the fishery is not precisely known.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As noted, Crane Prairie Reservoir is extremely shallow. At full pool it has an average depth of only 11 feet, and a maximum depth of just over 20 feet. The reservoir is lowered in the late summer by the withdrawal of water for irrigation, thereby exposing extensive areas of mud bottom. The water in the reservoir has a moderate alkalinity and moderate mineral content, slightly higher than other lakes and reservoirs of the region. However, in the summer the pH of the water is exceptionally high, frequently in excess of 9 and at times approaching 10. The high pH is caused by the growth of phytoplankton which frequently reach bloom proportions. The concentration of phosphorus is well above average for Cascade mountain lakes, and encourages algal blooms. The shallow depth of the lake may account for continuing high levels in the summer. The growth of phytoplankton in turn decreases the transparency of the water. Due to the extensive fluctuations in water level, aquatic weeds are not as common as they are in most shallow lakes. Nevertheless, there are extensive beds of <em>Elodea</em>, <em>Ceratophyllum</em>, and <em>Potamogeton</em> in places (McHugh 1972). Crane Prairie Reservoir is eutrophic according to all-indicators, and the high primary productivity supports a productive food chain and contributes to the abundance of fish and waterfowl.</p>

"Summer Lake","270","<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985)  Summer Lake is a large, shallow lake lying in an enclosed fault-block basin in south-central Oregon. Its major source of supply is the spring-fed Ana River and small snow-fed streams that rise on adjacent Winter Ridge. Summer Lake has no outlet and serves as an evaporation sump. The lake was discovered by Captain John C. Fremont in December, 1843. As he looked down from the ridge, which his party had climbed from the west, he saw the sun shining on the grass bordered lake. The contrast was so great that he named the mountain Winter Ridge and the lake Summer Lake. Winter Ridge is covered with timber, but the rest of the Summer Lake drainage basin is an arid landscape and supports only desert-type vegetation.
Summer Lake is very broad and shallow. At high stages (elevation 4149-4151 feet) it is about 15 miles long, about five miles wide, and covers an area of about 38,000 acres; yet its maximum depth is only five to seven feet. However, that level has rarely been attained in recent years. The flow of Ana Springs has decreased due to impoundment of the river and submergence of the spring orifices in 1923. There has also been increased use of water for irrigation. Therefore, inflow to the lake is less, and the average water level is now lower. There is considerable fluctuation between wet and dry years, and the lakebed has been almost entirely dry in the summers of many years since 1923. In 1981, for example, the lake was reduced to a stream channel surrounded by marshy areas. In all years, macrophytes are extremely abundant and serve as ideal waterfowl habitat. The marshy area at the northern end of the lake is managed as the 18,000-acre Summer Lake Wildlife Area.
The water quality in Summer Lake is influenced by both the shallow, marshy character and the extensive evaporation typical of this arid region. The total phosphorus concentration was 6.4 mg/l when sampled on 8/9/82, by far the highest of any lake in this survey. Chlorophyl was also very high (53.1 ug/1), although macrophytes and attached algae may have contributed more to this chlorophyl concentration than did phytoplankton. Zooplankton were observed to be abundant. High evaporation rates result in ""alkali"" conditions, with a very high conductivity (7000 umhos/cm) and high concentrations of major ions. All major ions are abundant except calcium and magnesium, which probably precipitate out of the water column. Only nearby Abert Lake has a higher conductivity. The water quality characteristics are distinctly hypereutrophic according to lake classification schemes.  However, Summer Lake should be viewed and managed more as a marsh than a lake.</p>","17120005004769","","149433632","01150595","Summer Lake","4"

"Croft Lake","179","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Croft Lake is a small natural lake on the southern Oregon coast and was, at one time, known as Crooks Lake. Its origin is similar to many others in the immediate area, for example New Lake immediately to the south. The circular lake basin lies in a shallow sag in a low marine terrace and was filled with water when the flow of Davis Creek was impounded by the build-up of sand dunes across its course. It is a relatively shallow lake and the water surface is barely above sea level. Extensive areas on the northern and southern ends are less than five feet deep. Much of the surrounding area is low marshland and during the wet periods in the winter the lake will expand to cover a surface area two or three times its normal summer level. Davis Creek is the primary surface inflow; the outflow at the northwest end wanders through the dunes to New River, which drains to the Pacific. Croft Lake is private and access is restricted. It is used primarily by local residents for swimming, boating and bass fishing.</p>
<p>The water in this shallow lake has a distinct greenish cast to it, a color due in part to the abundant growth of submerged macrophytes. The presence of algae and the turbidity may also contribute to the color. Strong winds prevent any stratification in the lake and keep it well-mixed and relatively turbid. Water in the lake has relatively low concentrations of chemical constituents, although it is influenced by sea spray. There are several private homes on the north shore and recreational use may contribute somewhat to nutrient enrichment. However, the concentration of phosphorus is about average for coastal lakes and the chlorophyl concentration is low, suggesting conditions at the lower end of mesotrophy. The lake is clear enough that a Secchi disk is visible on the bottom at the sample site, a depth of 11.5 feet (3.5 meters).</p>

"Mirror Lake","237","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Mirror Lake is located high in the Eagle Cap Wilderness of northeastern Oregon's Wallowa Mountains. At 26 acres in size it is the largest of the many lakes in an area known as the Lake Basin. Other nearby lakes include Horseshoe, Douglas and Moccasin Lakes; the latter receives the outflow from Mirror Lake. Minam Lake is located over a ridge to the west, and Glacier Lake over a ridge to the south. The imposing presence of Eagle Cap Mountain looms to the south of Mirror Lake and can be seen reflected in the water. The lake basin is the most popular destination for visitors to the Eagle Cap Wilderness, and is quite busy from July 4 through Labor Day. There are a large number of undeveloped, but heavily used campsites around the lake. Eastern brook trout are the only fish in Mirror Lake and produce well in late summer.</p>
<p>The lake consists of a single deep basin (maximum depth = 75 feet) carved out by an alpine glacier. Because of the high altitude (7560 feet), the water remains cool throughout the year. Bottom water remains perennially at the temperature of maximum density (39 degrees Fahrenheit; 4 degrees Celsius), and even at the height of summer stratification, surface temperatures seldom reach 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius). Water in the lake contains very little dissolved ionic material, and conductivity and alkalinity are among the lowest for lakes in the state. There is a modest amount of dissolved calcium, resulting from the weathering of glacial flour in the drainage basin. Water transparency is exceptionally high (41.7 feet; 12.7 meters) and is exceeded by only a few lakes in Oregon. The concentration of phosphorus is moderate, but phytoplankton populations and chlorophyl concentrations are very low. The productivity is sufficient to support the small population of resident brook trout. In summary, Mirror Lake is an exceptionally pristine alpine lake, and is classified as oligotrophic.</p>

"Monon Lake","239","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Monon Lake is one of countless mountain lakes and ponds in the Olallie Butte lake district north of Mt. Jefferson. Thick ice sheets occupied this part of the Cascade Range during the Pleistocene Epoch, carving and modifying the contours of the original volcanic terrain. As the ice finally melted about 10,000 years ago, only water was left to occupy the gentle but uneven landscape of rock basins and glacial moraines. The jumbled land has since been covered by a coniferous forest of hemlock, true fir, and pine; lakes, ponds, and wet meadows dot the area. There are few permanent streams; Monon Lake is fed chiefly by rain and melting snow, with only occasional inflow from two seasonal creeks.</p>
<p>In 1968 the Mt. Hood National Forest dedicated 14,238 acres as the Olallie Lake Scenic Area, to be managed primarily for back-country recreation and scenic preservation. The wooded shoreline of Monon Lake has been kept in an undeveloped condition, except for Skyline Road on the western shore. This road is usually closed by snow until June. Campgrounds are located nearby at Olallie Lake and at Breitenbush Lake to the south. An unimproved boat launch is available at Monon Lake, but parking is limited. As with other lakes in this area, no motors are allowed. Angling is considered good, mostly for stocked rainbows and a few brook trout. Monon Lake was named by a forest ranger because the word had a pleasing sound, although it is unknown whether the word actually has any meaning.</p>
<p>The lake consists of three interconnected basins: a large shallow basin making up most of the lake, a smaller but much deeper adjoining basin at the northeast end of the lake, and an isolated small basin connected to the main lake at the northwest end of the lake. The water in the lake is low in chemical constituents; concentrations of all the major ions, alkalinity and conductivity are among the lowest of any Oregon lakes. The concentration of phosphorus is also exceptionally low. The water is very transparent, and the lake bottom is visible even in the deepest part. Monon Lake is ultraoligotrophic.</p>

"Jubilee Lake","215","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Jubilee Lake (also known as Jubilee Meadows Reservoir) is a fairly new recreation reservoir in the Umatilla National Forest, a part of the state in which lakes are scarce. It is a cooperative effort between the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and the U.S. Forest Service. A rock and earthfill dam was built across Motett Creek in 1968, and the Forest Service built the roads and a very nice campground. A three mile hiking trail around the lake has been designated a National Recreation Trail. First stocked in 1968 with rainbow trout, the lake and recreation area attracted over 25,000 visitors in the first year of existence, and this level of use has continued. The small contributing drainage basin is an area of steep slopes covered by a thick coniferous forest. In addition to Motett Creek, there are a few small intermittent streams that provide inflow to the lake during the snowmelt season.</p>
<p>The shape of the impoundment is typical of reservoirs; there are four separate shallow arms along the north side of the lake where the water backs up into Motett Creek and its tributaries. The deepest portion of the reservoir is confined to a small area just behind the dam. The water in the lake is low in mineral constituents, with some of the lowest values for alkalinity, conductivity and major ion concentrations among reservoirs in eastern Oregon. Water transparency is good, indicating mesotrophic conditions. The concentrations of chlorophyl and phosphorus are also characteristic of mesotrophic ecological conditions. The lake develops a relatively shallow thermocline (between 15 and 25 feet; 4.5 to 7.6 meters) in the summer, indicating that it is sheltered from strong winds. The bottom water stays very cold (39 degrees Fahrenheit; 4 decrees Celsius), a legacy of the cold winters at this altitude and location. The bottom water has been observed to be anoxic in late summer, a situation that usually occurs only in eutrophic lakes. In Jubilee Lake, the anoxia may result from the small volume of the hypolimnion, which occupies less than 10 percent of the bottom of the reservoir, and from the import of incompletely decomposed organic matter from the watershed.</p>

"Clear Lake","52","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Clear Lake is one of a string of lakes on the central Oregon coast that lies on the 50-mile long North Florence dunal aquifer, an important groundwater body supplying water for domestic needs in the Florence area. The Heceta Water District withdraws directly from Clear Lake, an unfiltered domestic source of water that will require special protection for this use to continue. There is no public road to the lake, the only access being a one mile hike across extensive sand dunes. In spite of this limited access, some people do tow motorboats across the dunes and launch them on hard sand boat ramps.</p>
<p>The geologic origin of all the lakes in this group (Collard Lake, Clear Lake, Ackerly Lake and Munsel Lake) can be explained simultaneously. The dunal aquifer is an accumulation of aeolian (wind blown) sand that rests on an ancient wave cut terrace. This terrace can be seen at 50 to 150 feet above sea level along the coast to the north near Newport, and to the south near Bandon and Port Orford. However, along the coastal stretch from Coos Bay to Heceta Head the terrace has been warped downward below sea level and an extensive accumulation of sand deposited on it. This dunal sheet is of fairly recent geological origin. Carbon-14 dating of woody material deposited at the base of the sand and on top of the terrace clays showed that it originated about 27,000 years before present (Schlicker and Newcomb 1974). The dune sheet is broad and relatively flat and is composed of successive layers of sand that were built up as deflation plains behind eastward migrating sand dunes. The remnants of those dunes that have become stabilized and those which have not are the major topographic features on the dunal sheet surface. Clear Lake and others in this string lie along the eastern margin of the dune sheet, between the buildup of the dunal sheet to the west and next to impermeable bedrock to the east. As the migrating dunes approach the hills the wind loses its ability to transport sand and the largest portion of the sand remains to the west, thus leaving a depression or series of troughs along the base of the hills. Collard, Clear and Munsel Lakes are thus due to marginal ponding by dune masses, a mode of formation typical of many other lakes on the Oregon coast (Cooper 1958).</p>
<p>The sands of the North Florence Aquifer are a substantial water holding and transporting system. Permeability is high as indicated by a lack of streams originating on the sands, in spite of over 60 inches of annual precipitation. Most of the water percolates into the sand and discharges directly to the ocean. The only surface streams that cross the dune sheet, Sutton Creek to the north and the Siuslaw River to the south, derive most of their flow from the hills to the east; there is also substantial discharge of groundwater into these streams from the aquifer. The primary internal surface drainage system begins near Collard Lake and flows through a small stream to Clear Lake. A steady, year round flow of 1 to 2 cfs occurs in this stream. A portion of the outflow from Collard Lake flows to Clear Lake through sand that forms their western boundaries. Clear Lake water flows out by a surface stream to Ackerly Lake and then to Munsel Lake and Munsel Creek or it seeps into the sand aquifer system directly from the lake. Bottom material in Clear Lake is mostly clean sand. Small deposits of clay and organic mud occur along the north shore, in coves along the east shore, and at the outlet. These small clay and mud deposits are also the spots where a few macrophytes grow: water lilies, water shield, and rushes.</p>
<p>The most obvious features of the surrounding landscape are the areas of bare, mobile sand which contrast strikingly with the general forest cover. On the west side of the lake is the exposed ridge of a large active sand dune that is moving slowly eastward, encroaching on the water. Sand is constantly deposited in the lake on this side so that the bottom slopes away gently from the shore. In contrast, there is a steep slope on the east side of the lake basin where it abuts the abrupt rise of the Coast Range. The original forest on the eastern side of the drainage basin has been mostly logged off and is now covered partly by a second growth conifer forest, mixed with deciduous species, and partly by brush such as salal, rhododendrons, and huckleberry. Most of the land on these forest and brush covered slopes is owned by private timber companies. Development around Clear Lake is minimal. There is one house with a boathouse on the lake shore and, in the past, a sawmill was located at the north end near the inlet. The lake is reported to contain cutthroat trout and largemouth bass, but is certainly not fished heavily, nor used for any other recreational purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most coastal lakes in Oregon are either mesotrophic or eutrophic, due to a combination of heavy use, shallow depth, and rapid infilling of sediment. Clear Lake, however, is quite deep and is one of the few oligotrophic lakes on the coast. Woahink Lake and the Clear Lake south of Reedsport are two other examples of deep, oligotrophic coastal lakes. The water quality in Clear Lake is generally excellent. Chemical constituents exist in low concentrations due to &nbsp;the relatively inertquality of fresh sands and the high flushing rate from heavy rainfall and rapid groundwater movement. There is only slight enrichment of sodium and calcium and the alkalinity is very low. The concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyl and the transparency indicate a lower trophic state than in Collard Lake which discharges into Clear Lake from the north. All indications show that Clear Lake is relatively unproductive. Phytoplankton densities are low and only about 10 percent of the lake is shallow enough to permit the growth of macrophytes; they are not a problem as in so many of the coastal lakes. The phytoplankton densities and species reflect oligotrophic conditions. Cyclotella stelligera, which was dominant in May 1982, is also found in other oligotrophic lakes such as Woahink Lake, Clear Lake south of Reedsport, and Bull Run Lake on Mt. Hood. In November 1982 the phytoplankton was dominated by Rhodomonas minuta, which occurs in all types of lakes and is unreliable as an indicator species. Other algae found in November are Dinobryon bavaricum, often associated with waters having low phosphorus concentrations, and Rhizosolenia eriensis, which is also found in oligotrophic Bull Run Lake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of Clear Lake as a domestic water supply is certainly appropriate, but its continued use as an unfiltered source will require special protection from potential increases in nutrients. The potential for future degradation of this supply is very real. The Lane Council of Governments (L-COG) recently completed an extensive study of the North Florence Dunal Aquifer and the surface water of lakes and streams on the dune sheet (Christensen and Rosenthal 1982). The purpose of this study was to identify the existing and potential effects of development, especially on-site sewage disposal methods, on the quality of the water. The primary concern is that present and future development within the Clear Lake drainage basin will increase nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) levels in the lake water which would likely result in higher densities of phytoplankton. Lake data collected and analyzed during the L-COG study indicated that the phytoplankton are nitrate limited. The data show that the lake has an average NO3-N concentration of 0.05 mg/L. In order to protect the lake from adverse algal growth and quality degradation, the study determined that this average NO N concentration must not increase. The Clear Lake Aquifer drainage basin presently receives a loading of approximately 600-700 pounds NO3-N/year. Calculations indicate that with the volume of water discharged from the aquifer to Clear Lake, the NO3-N loading will have to be 170 pounds per year to meet the target level of 0.05 mg/L. The difference between the present 600-700 pounds loading and the projected 170 pounds loading and the impact on the lake is attributed to the inherent delay in the movement of the present loading through the aquifer to the lake. In other words, the aquifer is presently receiving a NO3-N loading which might be sufficient to have an impact on the lake but an impact is not being observed because of the time required for the nitrate to move through the groundwater to the lake.</p>

"Cape Meares Lake","164","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Cape Meares Lake (also known as Bayocean Lake) has a very unusual history. In 1952 Bayocean Spit, separating Tillamook Bay from the Pacific Ocean, was breached by storm waves through Biggs Cove at its southern end. This event was the final blow in the decline of Bayocean Park, an ill—fated resort community that had been established on the spit early in the century. Apparently, the supply of beach sand to the spit had been reduced over the years because of the construction of North Jetty at the mouth of Tillamook Bay. In an attempt to rebuild the spit, the Army Corps of Engineers in the 1950s constructed a long rock—and sand—filled dike along its east side. The Pacific shoreline was quickly reestablished, although sand has not yet filled in as far as the dike. That portion of open water remaining behind the dike is Cape Meares Lake, a shallow body of fresh water which will gradually shrink in size and disappear as sand dunes encroach from the west and sediments accumulate from the drainage basin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the south end of Bayocean Spit are extensive vernal pools and marshes which grade into the rich aquatic vegetation of the lake. The only surface inflow is through this bog area; outflow to Tillamook Bay is controlled through the dike. Waterfowl and marsh birds use the wetland habitat for breeding and feeding, while bass and rainbow trout are found in the lake. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has used the lake for fish—rearing, and the Nature Conservancy has expressed interest in the whole region because of the diversity of vegetation and habitat. The drainage basin to the south and the shoreline are primarily county land, thus assuring public access. Small boats can be carried onto the lake for recreation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to its exposure to strong Pacific winds and its very shallow depth Cape Meares Lake does not develop any pronounced temperature stratification. The swampy drainage basin contributes dissolved organic matter which imparts a brown tint to the water. Macrophytes cover much of this eutrophic lake and are the principal source of primary productivity. The conductivity and sodium/chloride concentrations are very high, second only to Eckman Lake among the coastal lakes included in this survey. High salinity is due to proximity to the ocean which supplies sea spray to the lake and its small drainage basin.</p>

"Charlton Lake","165","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Charlton Lake is a fairly large, but little known lake lying near the crest of the Cascade Range in Central Oregon. It is located on the western edge of the Deschutes National Forest, but is most easily accessible from Waldo Lake in the Willamette River Basin and Willamette National Forest. At an elevation of 5692 feet, it is one of the highest lakes in Oregon. It is a beautiful and pristine lake lying in a deep, glacial scoured basin, and surrounded by a dense coniferous forest. There are no perennial surface streams flowing into the lake; water is supplied from snowmelt runoff and by intermittent streams. There is probably also some subsurface seepage into and out of the lake. Charlton Creek, an intermittent stream that runs to the east, is the surface outlet. The primitive character of this part of the Cascades is enhanced in part by the lack of good roads. A primitive dirt road passes within 100 yards of Charlton Lake, requiring visitors to hike in. Angling is reported to be good, with brook trout providing most of the catch. A Forest Service campground is on the shore; no other facilities are available nearby. No motorboats are permitted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Charlton Lake is U-shaped and includes several small, shallow bays. It consists of two distinct deep basins connected by a somewhat shallower ridge which divides the lake down the middle. Characteristic of lakes in the area, concentrations of ions are very low and the conductivity value was one of the lowest observed in this survey. No macrophytes grow in the lake, although a few mosses grow attached to rocks. The concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyl are very low, reflecting the ultraoligotrophic nature of the lake. Water transparency is excellent, and the bottom is visible at a depth of 36 feet (11 meters). The lake takes on a distinctive turquoise color characteristic of very pure water. Charlton Lake does not receive heavy use and there are no plans for more extensive development around the shoreline. Therefore, the quality of its water, and the quality of the outdoor recreation experience at the lake, will most likely be maintained</p>

"Olallie Lake","108","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Olallie Lake is the largest of over 200 lakes and ponds that lie scattered about the base of Olallie Butte at the crest of the Cascade Range. It is within an area of 14,238 acres designated as the Olallie Lake Scenic Area, located in the southern tip of the Mt. Hood National Forest and part of the Clackamas Ranger District. The area was so designated in 1968 and is a very desirable summer recreation site. Forest roads extend into the area from three highways: U.S. Highway 26, 30 miles north of the area via Skyline Road; Oregon Highway 224, 25 miles northwest via Skyline and Clackamas River Roads; and Oregon Highway 22, 20 miles southwest via Skyline and Clackamas River Roads. The population centers of Portland and Salem provide most of the visitors to the area. Surfacing of the Skyline Road several years ago greatly increased the number of visitors. The name Olallie is used for a number of geographical features in Oregon, particularly along the Cascade Range. It is a word from Chinook jargon and means berries in general, or salmon berries. Its use along the Cascade Range generally meant huckleberries, and the area around Olallie Lake is covered with huckleberries that usually ripen by late August.</p>
<p>The recent geologic history of this high Cascade region is characterized by a combination of glaciation and recent volcanic activity. During the Pleistocene Epoch, the upland in the vicinity of Olallie Butte was covered by an ice sheet 500 to 1000 feet thick. The lower slopes of Olallie Butte were markedly steepened by this ice sheet and numerous landforms are evidence of this era. There are many U-shaped valleys, cirques, rock basins and some marshland. Glacial till, which covers the area, overlays an older andesite formation. The depth of the till varies from a thin veneer on ridges and slopes to relatively thick depths in morainal deposits and valley bottoms. The most conspicuous features are the numerous lakes that lie in basins in the rolling terrain of glacial till and moraines. Dozens of lakes visible from the summit of Olallie Butte are in rock basins scoured by the movement of glacial ice.</p>
<p>A volcanic landscape of this type typically has a poorly developed surface drainage system, and the lakes often have no identifiable inflow or outflow. Water to Olallie Lake is supplied by snowmelt runoff in seasonal streams, by direct precipitation, and by subsurface seepage through the volcanic terrain. A low dam with a barrier screen has been built across the outlet on Mill Creek to prevent the loss of stocked fish and to maintain the lake level. Thus the surface area of 188 acres is fairly constant. Mill Creek flows eastward to Long Lake.</p>
<p>The vegetation of the landscape around the lake is a forest complex typical for this elevation in the Cascades. Noble fir, pacific silver fir, western white pine, western hemlock, lodgepole pine, mountain hemlock and smaller amounts of Douglas fir, alpine fir, whitebark pine, Alaska yellow cedar and western red cedar make up the stand. The lodgepole pine has suffered considerably over the years from the attack of mountain pine beetles. There has been little harvesting of timber in the area in part because of the management objective of maintaining high recreation values. Marshy meadows of various sizes are also scattered throughout the area, one of the largest being Olallie Meadow, a 100 acre meadow lying just north of Olallie Butte.</p>
<p>Olallie Lake provides the opportunity for a variety of outdoor recreation activities. Several trails pass through the immediate area. One is a trail to the top of Olallie Butte, the dominant landform in the area, which is a composite volcanic cone of recent origin. From the top is a spectacular view, a 360 degree panorama of north-central Oregon. Fishing is the most important activity at Olallie Lake and at most of the other lakes in the Scenic Area. About a third of the northeast shoreline is developed, with a resort and a campground. Other shelters and picnic areas are scattered along the west shore, and there is a large campground on the narrow peninsula that juts into the lake. The lake is heavily used for swimming, boating, and fishing. It is stocked annually with rainbow trout and brook trout; kokanee are also present. No motorboats are allowed on the lake, in keeping with management objectives. The resort at the north end has boat rentals and supplies. The clear water also serves as a drinking water supply for the area.</p>
<p>Typical of most other lakes in this glaciated plateau, Olallie Lake is not very deep (average depth = 16.5 feet) and almost one-third of the lake is less than 10 feet deep. These littoral areas have mostly rock bottoms, whereas the rest of the lake has a bottom of mud, rock and debris. Considering the degree of development around its shores, Olallie Lake is in remarkably good condition. Mineral concentrationsare very low; concentrations of major ions, the alkalinity, and the conductivity are among the lowest observed anywhere in the state. The low mineral content is perhaps due to the fact that snow and rain, rather than inflowing streams, are the principal water source. The concentrations of chlorophyl and phosphorus are also exceptionally low. The water is sufficiently transparent to see the bottom even at the deepest point in the lake (43 feet). In all respects the lake is ultraoligotrophic, and seems to have changed very little since it was first surveyed in 1940 (Campbell 1940, McHugh 1972). Populations of phytoplankton are very low, and the species present are characteristic of very oligotrophic lakes. Although the lake is shallow, macrophytic growth is not supported on the rocky bottom. Because of its depth and altitude the water remains quite cool even in mid summer. Since Olallie Lake has been little affected by human encroachment, it is likely that it will remain oligotrophic for some time with proper management.</p>

"Garrison Lake","80","<div>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Garrison Lake is a shallow coastal lake located adjacent to the city of Port Orford and within its northeastern urban growth boundary. On some older maps the lake is shown as Garrison Lagoon, but the name Garrison Lake has been officially adopted. It was named for John B. Garrison, a pioneer settler who was with Captain William Tichenor when he founded the town of Port Orford in 1851. Garrison Lake is a typical sand dune lake, separated from the nearby ocean by a low ridge of shifting dunes. As with many of the coastal lakes in Oregon, it was formed when the post-glacial rise in sea level caused submergence of the lower reaches of coastal streams. In this case a small stream was unable to maintain its course across the encroaching sand dunes and the lake was separated from the ocean.</div>
<div>The only surface inflow to Garrison Lake from its small drainage basin is a small, intermittent stream entering at the northeast end. Surface outflow is to the southwest, where an intermittent stream follows a twisting route to the ocean a quarter of a mile distant. Generally there is no flow in this stream during the summer when lake level is low. A seasonal fluctuation in water level of Garrison Lake of about one and one-half feet is reported. The surrounding hillsides support a second-growth coniferous forest. Willows and California Madrona grow near the lake and much of the shoreline is in deep brush.</div>
<div>Garrison Lake is used for recreational boating, fishing, and swimming and has been an important part of the lifestyle of Port Orford residents for many years. About 85 percent of the shoreline is in private ownership and many homes have been built along the shore, especially in the last two decades. In past years the lake has yielded good catches of rainbow and cutthroat trout. It is stocked regularly and also supports some native cutthroat. However, because of the large amount of private land surrounding the lake, access is difficult and it is hard to fish. There are two access points for the general public: a gravel boat ramp maintained by Curry County on the northeast shore and a paved state ramp on the south shore. The nearest camping area is Humbug Mountain State Park, about four miles south of Port Orford.</div>
<div>Proximity to the ocean plays a major role in the natural thermal and chemical characteristics of Garrison Lake. Prevailing winds keep it well-mixed, preventing stratification and making the lake turbid at times. Concentrations of major ions in the water are somewhat above average for coastal lakes, reflecting its proximity to the ocean. Conductivity is also fairly high, due mostly to sodium and chloride derived from the ocean. Ecological conditions vary considerably over the course of the year. Major ion concentrations were similar in August, November, and February, but considerably lower in May. Total phosphorus and chlorophyl followed a similar pattern. During winter and late spring, concentrations are about average for coastal lakes and transparency slightly less than average. By late summer phosphorus and chlorophyl concentrations are well above average for coastal lakes, transparency is reduced, and there is a marked increase in pH.</div>
<div>The species of phytoplankton in Garrison Lake are somewhat unusual, and further reflect the varying ecological conditions throughout the year. In the spring <em>Dinobryon</em> was dominant; this alga is most often associated with lakes having low phosphorus concentrations and low trophic states. In summer <em>Desmidium</em> and <em>Nitzchia</em> were dominant; these algae are very rare (not observed in any other lake in this study) and indicate unusual conditions in the lake. <em>0ocystis</em> and <em>Sphaerocystis</em>, also observed in summer, are more common in oligotrophic lakes than in lakes with higher trophic states. The autumn phytoplankton assemblage consists of species that are widespread in many types of lakes. It appears that Garrison Lake, a complex ecosystem, is influenced by a large variety of factors.</div>
<div>Garrison Lake is not unlike many in the coastal area, with sandy shores and a considerable amount of macrophytes in the shallow areas. However, in the 1960s it began to suffer from the spread of macrophytes, to the extent that swimming and fishing have been restricted. Opinions concerning the causes of the macrophyte problem vary. Certainly the natural characteristics of the lake basin are a factor. Garrison Lake consists essentially of two basins connected by a shallow channel, the north basin being the larger and deeper of the two. The south basin is nowhere more than 12 feet deep and two thirds of the entire lake is shallower than 10 feet. In addition, poor water circulation results from poor drainage into and out of the lake. Thus, the lake would be expected to support a natural abundance of rooted macrophytes. A contributing factor is the in-filling through sediment accumulated from the drainage basin, a natural process which has been accelerated by road-building activity. The rapid eutrophication of Garrison lake in recent years suggests an overriding cultural influence, and the problem is severe. An anchor pulled from the 27 foot depth at the center of the lake in summer, 1982, was covered with Elodea. Apparently, the entire bottom is covered with this weed.There is also an abundant growth of phytoplankton in the lake which, many residents believe, is due to nutrient input from the city waste treatment plant. Other human-induced possibilities for the macrophyte and algae problems are: 1) accelerated sediment and nutrient loading from poor watershed management practices; 2) water draw-down for municipal use causing a lower lake level; 3) surface runoff contributing lawn and garden fertilizer; and 4) septic tanks draining into the lake and adding nutrients.</div>
<div>The water quality problems in Garrison Lake are severe and complex, involving a combination of several factors, both natural and cultural. Because it is such an important resource for residents of the Port Orford area, the interest in restoration potential will continue. The Curry and Coos County Council of Governments made tentative plans a few years ago to dredge the lake in an attempt to ameliorate the weed problem, but were not able to proceed because of a lack of funding. Dredging could be a feasible restoration technique in the event that it could economically remove a sufficient amount of sediment to reach the underlying sand. A variety of other potential solutions have been suggested for use either individually or in combination (CCCOG 1982):</div>

"Squaw Lakes","267","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;The Squaw Lakes are a pair of scenic mountain lakes in the upper drainage of the Applegate River basin about three miles north of the California state line. The larger of the two, known as Big or Lower Squaw Lake, is 46 acres in size. Little or Upper Squaw, 14 acres in size, is about one-half mile southeast of the larger lake and drains into it. Use is strictly recreational and access is limited by design so that the area can be managed as part of a ""primitive"" area by the Forest Service. The rough, gravel road to Big Squaw Lake thus stops about 200 yards short from where boats and camping gear must be carried on foot. Camping is by permit only and the Forest Service has designated 13 separate units around the lakes and along the stream between them.</p>
<p>Although the lakes and drainage basin are within the Rogue River National Forest there are some patches of private land. The lakes themselves were at one time privately owned. It has been recommended by Jackson County planners that the federal government purchase some of this land to allow coordinated management. A high priority for management is the protection of spawning grounds in the connecting stream and in the tributary to the upper lake. Grazing and the selected cutting of timber in the basin do not appear to have spoiled the primitive character of the area. In spite of the difficult access (or perhaps because of it) and a ban on the use of motorboats, the Squaw Lakes are very popular with outdoor enthusiasts, particularly anglers. Good catches are made of rainbow and trout, especially in spring and early fall. Crappies, bluegills and catfish are also taken.</p>
<p>The data presented in this report are from Big Squaw Lake, an unusually deep lake for its size (mean depth = 54 feet). The concentrations of major ions are surprisingly high for a pristine water body, especially of calcium and magnesium. Alkalinity and conductivity are also exceptionally high and pH has been observed to exceed a value of 8. Nevertheless, phosphorus and chlorophyl concentrations are low and the water is quite transparent (Secchi disk depth = 20.3 feet; 6.2 meters); these are indications of mesotrophic, nearly oligotrophic, conditions. Nevertheless, biological productivity appears to be high in the lake and the natural rate of replenishment of fish species is impressive. A diverse assemblage of macrophytes develops in the shallow waters and there is some evidence of oxygen depletion in the deeper water. A phytoplankton sample taken on 7/13/82 showed the-flagellate <em>Ceratium hirundinella</em> to be the dominant species. <em>Dinobryon sertularia</em>, <em>Melosira granulata</em>, and <em>Asterionella formosa</em> were also observed.</p>

"Langdon Lake","216","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Langdon Lake is a small and very shallow lake located near the summit of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon. It lies adjacent to the community of Tollgate along the highway between Weston and Elgin. Langdon is an artificial lake, formed by the construction of a dam on one of the sources of Lookingglass Creek. The name is from John W. Langdon of Walla Walla, who furnished a substantial part of the money necessary for surveying the site and building the dam. The lake is not open to the public for fishing. It is operated as part of a resort area, and angling is for patrons only. Most of the shoreline is privately owned, residential property. There is one small Forest Service campground at the west end of the lake; however, access to the water is not provided.</p>
<p>The maximum depth of Langdon Lake is only 10 feet, and this shallow depth has a pronounced effect on the ecological characteristics. Although the water has very low concentrations of common ions, the lake is distinctly eutrophic. It is too shallow to develop any permanent thermal stratification and it remains well mixed throughout the summer, keeping materials in suspension which might otherwise settle out. The concentrations of chlorophyl and phosphorus are well above average and give the lake a distinctly eutrophic character. Water transparency is very limited (2 feet; 0.6 meters); nevertheless, macrophytes cover much of the bottom.</p>

"Lookout Point Lake","223","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Lookout Point Lake is a very large reservoir which extends for more than 10 miles along the Middle Fork of the Willamette River into the Calapooya Mountains southeast of Eugene. It is one of 13 multi-purpose water resource projects built and operated by the Corps of Engineers throughout the Willamette Valley. Lookout Point Lake and Dexter Lake, a re-regulating basin immediately downstream, were both completed in 1954 and have since prevented an estimated $200 million in damages from downstream flooding. Lookout Point Dam is also important for the generation of hydroelectric power; its powerhouse has three generating units and puts out 120,000 kilowatts of power. Normally the water level will be kept at a high level from May through August. From July through September it is gradually lowered as much as 12 feet below full pool to meet downstream water needs. After September it is lowered more rapidly to make space for winter flood waters. The lake receives heavy recreational use, especially for boating, but is poor for fishing. It is heavily infested with rough fish, suckers and squawfish. Several picnicking and boat launching facilities are located around the lake, some provided by Lane County, others by the state and the Willamette National Forest. The seasonal draw-down generally limits lake access from these sites.</p>
<p>The drainage basin is a forested region stretching to the crest of the Cascade Mountains, with steep and dissected topography. About three-quarters of the basin is managed by the Willamette National Forest, with significant private holdings upstream around Oakridge and around the lower half of the lake.</p>
<p>Lookout Point Lake is deep enough that it develops a pronounced thermal stratification in the summer. The intakes for power generation are below the surface and cooler hypolimnetic water is discharged downstream to Dexter Lake. Water chemistry is average for Cascade reservoirs. The pH of the water sometimes exceeds 8, presumably because of algal growth in the water. Oxygen levels remain near saturation at all depths. Chlorophyl and phosphorus concentrations and water transparency suggest that the lake is mesotrophic. Algal blooms have sometimes been observed in the lake and the species observed suggest a higher trophic state. Macrophytes are absent from the littoral areas, as is the case in most reservoirs that experience large fluctuations in water level.</p>

"Willow Lake","290","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Willow Lake is a popular southern Oregon reservoir which stores the waters of Willow Creek, a tributary of the South Fork of Big Butte Creek. It is commonly known as Willow Creek Reservoir and this name appears routinely on maps. The 52-foot high, earthfill dam was completed in 1952 by the Medford Water Commission to store water as part of their municipal water system. Other uses are for irrigation and recreation. The contributing drainage basin is primarily within the Rogue River National Forest and drains the west slopes of Mt. McLoughlin. However, there are many sections of privately owned land within the broader National Forest boundaries. The lake itself is on county land, which has been developed by Jackson County as the Willow Lake Recreation Area. It includes facilities for camping and picnicking as well as a paved boat ramp. A small, private resort is also located on the shore. Willow Lake is heavily fished; kokanee were stocked about 1960 and have produced very well. Rainbow and cutthroat trout are also found, although in lesser numbers.</p>
<p>Water in Willow Lake has low concentrations of major ions, and the alkalinity and conductivity are less than average for reservoirs in the Rogue Basin. Concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyl are moderate, and water transparency is average, indications of a mesotrophic lake. However, Willow Lake is not without serious water quality problems. It is a relatively shallow water body, especially in the southern arms where Willow Creek and Bieberstedt Creek enter, and it varies considerably in depth and area throughout the year because of irrigation withdrawals. Macrophytes are observed growing excessively in these shallow areas. Algal blooms are not uncommon and they give the water a greenish hue. A past history of sewage discharge into the lake has contributed to water quality problems. In fact, Willow Lake is the location of what was probably the first recorded case, in Oregon, of mass poisoning of swimmers by blue-green algae. Sewage from the campground and the small resort is treated in a small treatment structure. Presumably, the treated effluent eventually enters the water, as evidenced by the fact that oxygen depletion is sometimes pronounced below a depth of 20 feet (6 meters). On the sample date of 7/15/82 a bloom of <em>Gloeotrichia echinulata</em>, a blue-green alga, was dominant. Other blue-greens, <em>Aphanizomenon flos-aquae</em> and <em>Anabaena sp.</em> were also observed. All these species are distinct indicators of enriched conditions. The combination of parameters suggests that a classification of eutrophic is appropriate.</p>
<p>McHugh (1979) has proposed methods to alleviate this problem of enrichment. The effluent could be piped past the lake and released below the dam or, as is now done at Emigrant Lake, accumulated and periodically sprayed on adjacent forested areas or dry hillsides. Another suggestion is to take advantage of the seasonal drawdown and deepen the reservoir near the shoreline. Such deepening would limit the now excessive growth of macrophytes in shallow water and, by reducing total surface area, would decrease evaporative loss and water warming.</p>

"Trail Bridge Reservoir","280","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Trail Bridge Reservoir, adjacent to U.S. Highway 126 along the Upper McKenzie River, was built in 1963 by the Eugene Water and Electric Board as one of three area reservoirs in the Carmen-Smith Hydroelectric Development. The entire system supplies 113,000 kilowatts of peak power to the Eugene area, 70 miles to the west. The unique feature of power production at Trail Bridge Reservoir is the diversion of part of the McKenzie River through a tunnel into Smith Reservoir, and then back into the McKenzie River at Trail Bridge through a power tunnel and penstock. A small power plant is also located at the 98-foot high rockfill dam that forms the reservoir.</p>
<p>The drainage basin of the reservoir straddles the geologic border between the older, deeply eroded western Cascades, and the younger High Cascades, which are characterized by relatively fresh volcanic terrain. The steep, forested slopes of the Smith River sub-basin contrast sharply with the relatively young, unvegetated lava block fields in the northwest region of the basin. Recreation was a planned feature of Trail Bridge Reservoir, and the Willamette National Forest operates a 33-unit campground on the north shore. Rainbow trout are stocked annually, and the Eugene Water and Electric Board has cooperated with state and federal agencies in developing an artificial spawning facility for chinook salmon immediately downstream. A 10 mph speed limit for boats is in effect on the reservoir.</p>
<p>The major ion chemistry, alkalinity and conductivity of the water are typical of reservoirs in the Willamette drainage basins. Phosphorus concentrations are somewhat above average, but chlorophyl concentrations and water transparency indicate that the reservoir is oligotrophic.</p>

"Gold Lake","203","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Situated high in the Cascade Mountains between Odell and Waldo Lakes is Gold Lake, one of the scenic and botanical treasures of the Willamette National Forest. It is adjacent to one of the finest examples of a subalpine sphagnum bog in the Cascades. To assure the preservation of this prime wetland and its rare vegetation, a 463-acre tract extending upstream from the lake was dedicated in 1965 as the Gold Lake Bog Research National Area. Formal permission to visit the R.N.A. is required, and inquiries can be made at the District Ranger Station in Oakridge.</p>
<p>The lake itself is a fairly popular recreation site and is considered a good trout lake. Fishing is restricted to fly-angling and no motorboats are allowed. Brook trout and rainbow trout are taken. These species are stocked, but appear to maintain themselves well because of the short fishing season and the restrictions on tackle. Tributaries of the lake are closed to fishing as is the outlet stream. A good Forest Service campground is located on the shore near the outlet.</p>
<p>Surface inflow is primarily from Salt Creek which passes through the bog before entering the lake. Springs along the northern side of the lake also contribute to surface inflow. Salt Creek, the outlet stream, is a tributary of the Middle Fork of the Willamette River, joining it 28 miles downstream from Gold Lake. Several beaver dams in the area are effective in maintaining water levels in the lake and adjacent bog. The drainage basin is underlain by andesite basalt, typical of this portion of the High Cascades, and covered by wind-blown deposits of ash and pumice. In the low-lying areas deep, organic soil profiles have developed. Engleman spruce and subalpine fir surround much of the lake and bog, while mountain hemlock and subalpine fir dominate the steep ridges that parallel the lake on both sides.</p>
<p>The lake basin has a simple oval shape with a single deep area along the southeastern edge. Although it is not very deep, the water column develops a distinct temperature stratification with very cold water persisting below 20 feet (6 meters) in summer. The water in the lake is low in major ion concentrations, but not as low as nearby Waldo Lake and several other Cascade lakes. Drainage through the bog area into Gold Lake clearly influences these characteristics. Although the water in the lake is transparent, it has a definite brownish cast caused by organic matter drained from the bog. In fact, this color often appears to be gold and may well be the origin of the name of the lake. Dissolved oxygen becomes depleted in the bottom water, further indicating a direct influence of bog drainage. Phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations suggest mesotrophic conditions. Gold Lake is more productive than most Cascade lakes but is certainly not eutrophic. Two species of blue-green algae were observed on 7/18/82: <em>Gloeotrichia echinulata</em> and <em>Anabaena sp.</em>, as well as the planktonic rotifer <em>Conochilus unicornis</em>.</p>

"South Twin Lake","264","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;North and South Twin Lakes are two of the many high country lakes in the Deschutes National Forest that are easily accessible from the Cascade Lakes Highway. They lie east of the Deschutes River, which at this point is the north arm of Wickiup Reservoir. Both lakes are nearly circular, about one-half mile in diameter, and are of volcanic origin. South Twin Lake formed when rising magma within the earth's crust came in contact with groundwater. The resulting explosion created a crater which later filled with water. There is no surface inflow or outflow to or from the lake; water enters by seepage and direct precipitation, and is lost by seepage and evaporation. Hydrologic retention time is estimated to be 22 years, one of the highest for lakes in this study. Maximum depth is nearly 60 feet and the bottom drops off steeply from the shoreline, leaving very little shallow water.</p>
<p>The Twin Lakes have long been noted for fine fishing. In 1940, former President Hoover visited the lakes for this purpose. However, the history of fishing success has been off and on. South Twin Lake was the first in Oregon to be treated for scrap fish (1941); the treatment was a success and served as a model for other lakes. Unfortunately, chubs were reintroduced and the lake has had to be treated several times since. Nevertheless, it remains a good trout lake and continues to receive heavy use from anglers. A resort on the shore has new and rustic cabins and a lodge that offers supplies and rents boats. On the north shore is a Forest Service campground. No motorboats are allowed on the lake.</p>
<p>Water quality in South Twin Lake is unusual. Concentrations of major ions, alkalinity, and conductivity are well above average for mountain lakes of the Cascades, although slightly less than in nearby North Twin Lake. Sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium concentrations are second only to North Twin Lake among the Cascade lakes in this survey. The pH is also above average, phosphorus concentration is moderate, and chlorophyl concentration is low. Water transparency, although high, is slightly less than in North Twin Lake. The survey of 7/19/82 supported the findings of an Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife survey in 1940 which also found the lake to have some unusual characteristics (Newcomb 1941). Temperatures were 65.1° F. (18.40 C.) at the surface, and 46.6° F. (8.10 C.) at the bottom on 9/6/41, and there was a thermocline between 15 and 25 feet. Enough oxygen to support trout was found at 17 feet, less than 5 ppm from 17 to 25 feet, and none below 25 feet. The lower water contained 40.0 ppm of carbon dioxide, and was acid in reaction, while water above 25 feet was alkaline. The bottom deposits contained the lowest number of invertebrate organisms of any of the 40 Deschutes National Forest lakes surveyed in 1940. Low oxygen and high carbon dioxide might indicate oxidation of large amounts of organic matter in the hypolimnion, or the presence of mineral springs, which are not uncommon in this area of recent volcanism. The surface waters show no evidence of excessive enrichment and no macrophytes grow in the lake. <em>Dinobryon divergens</em> is present, indicating low phosphorus content. Water transparency and chlorophyl concentrations indicate that South Twin Lake is oligotrophic. However, the oxygen profile, major ion and phosphorus data identify the lake as generally mesotrophic.</p>

"Strawberry Reservoir","269","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Strawberry Reservoir is a relatively small, shallow reservoir located in the southeast portion of the Klamath Basin and in the headwater portion of the Gerber Reservoir drainage basin. It was built in the 1920s by a private party to store water for irrigation of land in Barnes Valley a few miles to the northwest. An eight-foot high earthfill dam impounds the headwaters of Strawberry Creek, a small. drainage area of slightly over two square miles. Nevertheless, it is the principal storage for water that now irrigates hundreds of acres ii the Barnes Valley. The name of the reservoir is taken from Strawberry: Creek and there are several other features nearby with the same name e.g., Strawberry Butte, Strawberry Spring and Strawberry Flat, the( latter a broad plateau to the west of the reservoir.</p>
<p>Water in the reservoir has low concentrations of all major ions and the conductivity and alkalinity are low. The water is sufficient); transparent that the bottom is visible everywhere. Macrophytes cove] the entire bottom and are responsible for most of the primary; productivity of the reservoir. Phytoplankton are not abundant and the chlorophyl concentration in open water is therefore low. The water column does not develop any significant stratification, and it was well: oxygenated throughout when observed (7/6/82). Although the productivity; of macrophytes is high, the reservoir appears to be mesotrophic as determined by most other indices.</p>

"Summit Lake","271","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Summit Lake, at an elevation of 5553 feet above sea level, is so named because it is situated very nearly on the divide between the Willamette River Basin and the Deschutes River Basin. The name was apparently first used in 1865 by B. J. Pengra and W. H. Odell while making a reconnaissance for the Oregon Central Military Road. A small drainage basin of about eight square miles contributes to the lake. There are no perennial surface streams in this terrain; inflow is by snowmelt runoff, direct precipitation, and subsurface seepage. Surface outflow is into Summit Creek which discharges into Crescent Lake four miles to the east. Vegetation cover is a coniferous forest, typical of the High Cascades at this elevation.</p>
<p>Because of the high elevation, access to Summit Lake is possible only three to four months a year. There is one Forest Service campground on the northwest shoreline. Recreational use of the lake is comparatively light, because many people use the campground as a base from which to reach other small lakes in the vicinity. Biological productivity in Summit Lake is low and fishing is only fair. Eastern brook trout are stocked, but are difficult for anglers to locate; rainbow trout are also stocked, and there is a small population of mackinaw.</p>
<p>The shape of the lake basin is rather complex with several deeper holes and some underwater ridges and hills. The shoreline is also highly indented, particularly along the northern shore, which is flanked by a relatively recent lava flow. Water in the lake is extremely low in concentrations of major ions, alkalinity, and conductivity. Concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyl are also very low. All indicators identify this lake as ultraoligotrophic. The water is very transparent giving the lake the lovely turquoise color characteristic of very pure water.</p>

"","","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Malheur Lake lies in the Malheur/Harney Lake Basin in southeastern Oregon. It represents a remnant of a much larger waterbody that existed during the Pleistocene Epoch when precipitation was greater and evaporation less. At its highest level this ""pluvial"" lake is estimated to have been 900 square miles in surface area, with a maximum depth of 35 feet (Phillips and Van Denburgh 1971). It overflowed eastward into the Snake River via the Malheur River. Drainage was first through a channel near Princeton, and later through a gap at Crane when Pleistocene lavas blocked the former channel (Baldwin 1976). About 10,000 years ago warmer and drier conditions caused the pluvial lake to shrink, and the water no longer had an outlet to the sea. Much of this former lake bottom is now brush-covered desert and seasonally flooded grass-sedge meadowland, with Malheur and Harney Lakes existing as remnants of the former Pleistocene lake.</p>
<p>The first written information about Malheur and Harney Lakes is in Peter Skene Ogden's journal of his third Snake River expedition. On November 1, 1826, his party first sighted the lakes. Ogden did not name them but he did refer to the ridge or dike that separated the large freshwater lake from the salt water to the west. In 1859 an infantry division under Captain H. D. Wallen, while on an expedition from The Dalles to Great Salt Lake, reached the salt water and named it Lake Harney. The horses would not drink the alkaline water and stampeded over the dike eastward to what is now Malheur Lake. Wallen tnereupon named the fresh water body Lake Stampede, a name that has not prevailed. Malheur Lake was eventually named for Malheur River, the name used by Ogden in 1826 (River au Malheur = ""unfortunate river"") because of property and furs having been hid there and then discovered and stolen by natives. It is not known when the name was first applied to the lake (McArthur 1974).</p>
<p>Malheur Lake is, in effect, a freshwater marsh, one of the largest in the country. It has long been one of the most productive waterfowl breeding areas in the United States, and is a vital migration habitat for birds on the Pacific Flyway. In 1908 President Theodore Roosevelt dedicated the area as a bird refuge, and the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge now comprises nearly 160,000 areas of open water, vast tule swamps, wild meadows, and wooded areas. It is a remarkable area, and well over 200 different species of birds have been found on and adjacent to the Malheur Refuge.</p>
<p>The hydrology of the Malheur Lake Basin has a direct and powerful effect on the size and on the limnological character of the lake. Historically, it has been dry during extreme droughts; for example it was completely dry in 1934 and nearly dry in 1926, 1931-33, and 1961-62 (Phillips and Van Denburgh 1971). At high-water levels the surface area exceeds 50,000 acres, with a maximum depth of about 6 feet. In the early 1980s a sequence of wet winters caused extensive flooding in the basin, with the water of Malheur and Harney Lakes extending well past their ""normal"" shorelines. At a water surface elevation of 4091.5 feet (maximum depth = 2.5 feet), water flows through The Narrows, a winding weed-grown channel, to Mud Lake. At higher levels it overflows the dike into Harney Lake, the sump, or end point, of this large naturally-closed basin. Harney Lake thus has become very alkaline, losing water only via evaporation, while Malheur Lake is periodically freshened.</p>
<p>The topographic drainage basin to Malheur Lake is 3083 square miles, of which approximately 30 percent is non-contributing. Inflow of water is from four principal sources -- surface runoff from the Silvies River and the Donner und Blitzen River, Sodhouse Spring on the periphery of the lake, and direct precipitation on the lake surface (Hubbard 1975). The Donner und Blitzen River, draining an area of 760 square miles, is the largest contributor. It is supplied primarily by snowmelt from Steens Mountain., but its flow into Malheur Lake is substantially reduced by upstream diversions for irrigation. The Silvies River has a drainage area of approximately 1200 square miles, and during spring flooding water enters the lake through both the East Fork and the West Fork channels and at many points between the two channels. The river contributes less inflow to the lake than does the Donner und Blitzen because of the large quantity of water diverted for irrigation. Inflow from all streams and springs has been estimated to average about 100,000 acre-feet per year (Phillips and Van Denburgh 1971). Since the capacity of the lake basin at the overflow elevation is only slightly more than this, about 120,000 acre-feet, overflow occurs frequently.</p>
<p>Water chemistry in Malheur Lake is variable and is strongly influenced by hydrological events. The lake as a whole becomes appreciably more saline during dry periods and more dilute during wet periods, because of solute depletion by overflow. The lake may be divided into three distinct sub-basins which differ substantially in ecological character (Duebbert 1969). The central basin, east of Graves Point and west of Cole Island, is the deepest and receives the flow ofthe Donner und Blitzen and Silvies Rivers, making it relatively less saline. The dominant emergent macrophyte is hard stem bull rush (<em>Scirpus sp.</em>) and the commonest submerged macrophyte is water milfoil (<em>Myriophyllum exalbescens</em>). This sub-basin is heavily colonized by herons, egrets, grebes, and terns during nesting season. The eastern sub-basin lies east of Cole Island dike, but there is no exit so that evaporation and lack of flushing cause the water to become considerably more saline. An exception is the concentration of calcium which sometimes is lowest in the eastern basin where biogenic precipitation of calcite removes calcium. In this sub-basin, there is less growth of emergent macrophytes but extensive growth of the submerged macrophyte Sago pondweed (<em>Potamogeton pectinatus</em>), an important food source to ducks. The western sub-basin lies west of Graves Point and consists of a complex of interconnected channels and ponds. There is considerable growth of emergent macrophytes; the most important submerged macrophyte is Sago pondweed. As noted, during wet years water rises in Malheur Lake until it overflows from the western basin through Mud Lake and on into Harney Lake. Therefore, during wet years, the western basin of Malheur Lake is also flushed with fresh water.</p>
<p>Primary production in Malheur Lake is very high and the lake is therefore classified as eutrophic. The primary production is dominated by the growth of macrophytes with relatively little contribution by phytoplankton. The unfortunate introduction of carp into the basin, probably in the early 1920s, is thought to have disturbed the ecology of the lake basin. Carp have sometimes reached enormous population densities, and their bottom scouring activities cause the resuspension of bottom sediment. Submerged macrophytes suffer because of the alteration of light caused by the resuspended sediment. Efforts to eliminate the carp with protenone have been unsuccessful.</p>

"Winopee Lake","292","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Winopee Lake is one of the many backcountry delights scattered throughout the southern half of the Three Sisters Wilderness. This region is not as spectacular as the northern half where magnificent volcanic peaks rise above timberline. However, its appeal is great, and the many small lakes are the focus of most recreational activity. Winopee Lake is most commonly reached via a five-mile trail from the west end of Cultus Lake. Winopee is a Chinook jargon word meaning by-and-by or wait. The name was probably applied to the lake by someone who was in no hurry to leave.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A dense forest, composed primarily of lodgepole pine, surrounds the lake. However, Winopee Lake is perhaps more marsh than lake. Open water, unobstructed by emergent macrophytes, is only about 30 acres; there is a basin at the northern end which is about 40 feet deep. Two long, marshy arms reach to the south. Several small surface streams enter the lake, the largest being the outflow from the &nbsp;Snowshoe Lakes. A sluggish outflow stream from the southeast arm reaches Muskrat Lake, a small waterbody which is rapidly converting to a marsh, and from there the flow is into Cultus Lake. Several rock outcrops decorate the eastern and northern shoreline of the lake. Winopee is a biologically rich lake as evidenced by the dense macrophyte growth over all the shallow area. Wildlife abounds in the area and fishing is very good for the numerous, but small, rainbow trout. The extensive growths of macrophytes and the naturally low biological productivity restrict the growth of fish in the lake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Water quality in Winopee Lake is excellent; concentrations of major ions, alkalinity, and conductivity are all very low. The pH of the water, 6.6, is a little less than average for lakes in the area. Chlorophyl and phosphorus concentrations are also very low and the water is very transparent. The lake is oligotrophic.&nbsp;</p>

"Threemile Lake","276","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;The Threemile Lakes are a pair of long, narrow lakes in the sand dunes of the central Oregon coast and are presented here as one unit. They are named for nearby Threemile Creek which flows into the Pacific Ocean. The creek was named on the assumption that its mouth is three miles from the Umpqua River; in fact it is about four miles. This is a relatively isolated region dominated by a developed system of foredunes and active dunal ridges. As the dunes advanced inland they formed linear depressions which now contain long, narrow lakes parallel to the shoreline. The Threemile Lakes are a typical example of this mode of formation, lying in a trough between an active ridge on the west and older, stabilized dunes to the east. The surface elevation (20 feet) and maximum depth (33 feet) of the lakes suggest that the basin is a cryptodepression, a lake basin extending to below sea level.</p>
<p>Surface inflow is from a small, unnamed creek on the north end, which enters through a marshy area, and from two other small, intermittent streams. There is no surface outflow; seepage and evaporation account for seasonal reductions in water level. In the summer, because of the drop in water level, two separate lakes exist connected by a short, narrow channel. In some years even this channel dries up so that the lakes are completely separate. Dense brush is found around the perimeter of the lakes except at the northwest end where dunes are actively encroaching on the waterline. Although the Threemile Lakes are within the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, most of the terrain to the east is owned and managed by private timber interests and is covered with a second—growth Douglas fir forest. The rest of the drainage basin is under federal management.</p>
<p>Water transparency is above average for coastal lakes (Secchi disk depth = 13.1 ft; 4 m), suggesting low productivity, and there is no evidence of emergent macrophytes. Submerged macrophytes are apparent on the lake bottom in the shoal area, except where encroaching sand restricts their development. The lakes are exposed to strong prevailing winds and do not stratify significantly. Based on the Secchi disk readings they are classified as mesotrophic.</p>
<p>The Threemile Lakes contain a variety of fish species, notably cutthroat trout and yellow perch. However, due to the limited access the lakes are little visited and have remained relatively undisturbed. There are apparently no plans for further development and it is reasonable to expect that their quiet, primitive character will be retained.</p>

"Devil Lake","183","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Devil Lake is a small irrigation reservoir in the semi-arid rangeland of south central Oregon. Although located within the boundary of the Fremont National Forest, about half the lake and its small contributing drainage area are on privately owned land. It was formed by the construction of a low earth and rockfill dam which impounds the waters of a small area tributary to Fishhole Creek. Storage in the reservoir permits flow in the creek to be augmented at critical times necessary for the irrigation of several hundred acres about five miles downstream. There are no recreational facilities at the lake, but it does receive use by fishermen. It was treated for scrap fish some years ago and restocked with rainbow trout. However, warm water species (crappies, perch and catfish) now dominate and attract many fishermen. Open all year, the best fishing is reported to be in the fall. No motors are allowed on the lake.</p>
<p>Devil Lake is shallow (maximum depth = 19 feet; mean depth = 11 feet), and the water level fluctuates as a result of irrigation withdrawals. Major ion concentrations, conductivity and alkalinity are typical of reservoirs in this part of the state, and the concentrations of calcium and sulfate are somewhat higher than other ions. Biological productivity is high, as is the phosphorus concentration. Water transparency is thus very limited and the lake is obviously eutrophic. The concentration of chlorophyl is not as high as might be expected, and the brownish coloration of the water suggests that some of the inhibition of transparency may be due to suspended sediment. In spite of the eutrophic nature of the reservoir there is relatively little growth of rooted macrophytes.</p>

"Harney Lake","205","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Harney Lake is the lowest point in the Malheur/Harney Lake Basin, a large naturally closed basin in southeast Oregon. Before being blocked by a geologically recent lava flow, the basin drained to the Pacific Ocean by way of the Malheur, Snake, and Columbia Rivers. Thus, it is different from most of the other closed basins of eastern Oregon in the sense that the interior drainage is due to obstruction by a lava flow rather than to the faulting typical of the Great Basin area. In very wet years the lake receives overflow from Malheur Lake to the east through a channel called The Narrows. The two lakes were first seen by non-native people on Peter Skene Ogden's third Snake River expedition in 1826, and the name Harney was bestowed in 1859 in honor of Brigadier-General W. S. Harney, then in charge of the Army Department of Oregon.</p>
<p>During most of historical time Harney Lake has, in fact, been dry. It last dried up in 1963 and the basin remained a salt flat until the early 1980s when a series of wet years brought the water to its highest level in modern history. Several adjacent cattle ranches as well as the main north-south highway (Oregon Highway 205) were flooded. Between climatic wet spells, the lake water is gradually evaporated, and because of the evaporation and the dissolution of salt deposited in the sediment from previous drying cycles, it is very salty when it does contain water. It becomes progressively brinier as it again dries up, eventually leaving a residue of salty mud sediment. In its present condition (1983) the lake is about one tenth as salty as sea water. Of the lakes included in this survey, only Lake Abert and Summer Lake are more saline.</p>
<p>During the sampling of 7/2/82, it was noted that suspended sediment and planktonic algae severely limited water transparency. The concentration of phosphorus was very high and considerably in excess of the amount necessary to stimulate the growth of planktonic algae. According to conventional criteria, Harney Lake is clearly very eutrophic. Its ecological character, however, is primarily a consequence of the high salinity and wet/dry cycles which result from its position as the lowest basin in an area of inland drainage, rather than a consequence of nutrient supply.</p>

"Beulah Reservoir","42","<p>
<p>(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). Beulah Reservoir (formerly known as Agency Valley Reservoir) is a large impoundment in &nbsp;the Malheur River system in northeast Oregon. It was formed by the 121-foot high Agency Valley Dam, which was built in 1935 to impound the flow of the North Fork of the Malheur River near Beulah, Oregon. At full pool the reservoir covers about 2000 acres and has a storage capacity of over 60,000 acre-feet. It is one of the major components of the Bureau of Reclamation's Vale Project, an irrigated area of about 35,000 acres located along the Malheur River and Willow Creek, surrounding the town of Vale. The project stores water in Warm Springs Reservoir, Beulah Reservoir, and Bully Creek Reservoir. The stored water in Warm Springs and Beulah Reservoirs, together with natural streamflow, is diverted from the Malheur River by the Harper Diversion Dam to the Vale Main Canal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lands now included in the Vale Project were irrigated as early as 1881 by settlers who built small distribution systems that diverted water directly from the Malheur River. Independent ditch companies were formed as irrigated acreages increased, and by the 1920s more than 63,000 acres were being irrigated. At the request of local interests, the Bureau of Reclamation began investigations in 1925 to determine the feasibility of developing a project in the area. In 1926 the Bureau purchased a half interest in the Warm Springs Dam and Reservoir. The Harper Diversion Dam was completed in 1929, the Vale Main Canal in 1935, Agency Valley Dam and Beulah Reservoir also in 1935, and the Bully Creek Dam and Reservoir in 1963. The project is operated and maintained by the Vale Oregon Irrigation District. In addition to the transformation of thousands of acres of sagebrush and ranchland into productive farmland, the three reservoirs are operated on a coordinated forecast basis for flood control. Of the three, Beulah Reservoir provides the best opportunities for recreation. There are campgrounds and facilities for launching and mooring boats, but no camping improvements. The reservoir is open to angling all year, and has provided good sport. It has been treated for rough fish several times, and then restocked with rainbow trout. Dolly Varden trout and whitefish are also in the reservoir. Because of the broad oval shape of the reservoir and the absence of obstructions in the water, powerboating and water-skiing are popular recreational pursuits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beulah Reservoir is nestled in Agency Valley, almost filling the small triangular valley. It receives drainage from an area of 440 square miles, most of this from the North Fork of the Malheur River. The upper part of the basin is a forested portion of the Blue Mountains within the Malheur National Forest. At lower elevations is rangeland, some of it privately owned, but most of it under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management. The shoreline of the reservoir is also federal land.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The North Fork of the Malheur River has excellent water quality, and as a result Beulah Reservoir has better water quality than most eastern Oregon reservoirs. This condition is further encouraged by the greater depth in the reservoir as compared to others. Major ion concentrations are about average for eastern Oregon reservoirs; however, the total phosphorus concentration is somewhat higher (0.072 mg/1). The reservoir was thermally stratified when sampled on 6/24/82. At this time, only a slight depletion of hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen was found; however, later in the summer it would be expected to be greater. Although water transparency and chlorophyl concentration indicate mesotrophic conditions on the sampling date, these would probably shift to eutrophic conditions later in the summer. Overall, Beulah Reservoir is classified as eutrophic, but at the low end.&nbsp;</p>

"Lake Simtustus","261","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Lake Simtustus, also known commonly as Pelton Reservoir, is a large power-generating reservoir on the mainstem of the Deschutes River. It is located immediately downstream from Lake Billy Chinook. Pelton Dam was the first high dam on the river, built in 1958 by Portland General Electric. It is a 200-foot high, concrete arch structure. With the subsequent construction of Round Butte Dam, Lake Simtustus serves also as a reregulating reservoir, or surge basin, to handle releases from Lake Billy Chinook. The Warm Springs Indians chose the name Simtustus to honor a warrior of the tribe who served as a scout for the U. S. army in the 1867-68 campaign against the Paiutes.</p>
<p>Lake Simtustus is a long, narrow impoundment, about eight miles long and no more than one-quarter mile wide at any point. The contributing drainage basin includes the entire Deschutes River basin above this point, a mostly semi-arid rangeland with forested mountains in the headwater area. Surroundings are mostly steep canyon walls, with some more level sagebrush-grass grazing areas. Direct inflow to the reservoir, other than that from Lake Billy Chinook, is from an area of about 320 square miles via intermittent streams; Willow Creek and Seekseequa Creek are the major streams. The Warm Springs Reservation adjoins the lake on the west side and access is restricted. Federal land administered by the Bureau of Land Management comprises the eastern shoreline. The power company maintains a public campground and picnic area just above the dam. There are also a marina and boat launching ramps, and summer &nbsp;use for fishing and boating is fairly heavy. A variety of trout are caught; also present are bass, bluegills, crappies, and catfish. A license from the Warm Springs Tribe is required to fish, although state fishing regulations apply.</p>
<p>Lake Simtustus is deep enough (average depth = 53 feet) to develop a noticeable temperature stratification during the summer. The concentrations of major ions are fairly high, and other chemical characteristics are very similar to the water of Lake Billy Chinook upstream. Although Billy Chinook traps much of the sediment from the extensive drainage basin, water transparency in Lake Simtustus is also limited. &nbsp;Some of the fine sediment remains in suspension, and phytoplankton are abundant. Light blooms of blue-green algae (<em>Aphanizomenon flos-aquae</em> with some <em>Gloeotrichia echinulata</em>) are common and to be expected in a warm lake with a mud-bottom and sufficient sodium. The concentration of phosphorus is high and stimulates phytoplankton growth. Oxygen is sometimes moderately depleted in the deeper water. The overall character of the reservoir is eutrophic. However, there is very little growth of macrophytes around the lake, probably due to fluctuations in the water level.</p>

"Gerber Reservoir","201","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Gerber Reservoir is a large impoundment which functions as a vital component of the Klamath Project, a large, two—state water resource system which serves the irrigation demands of approximately 234,000 acres. The Bureau of Reclamation is responsible for the development and operation of this project which provides irrigation, flood control, recreation, and fish and wildlife benefits. Gerber Reservoir was built in 1925 with the completion of a dam across Miller Creek. The dam and reservoir were named for Louis Gerber, an early settler who owned a considerable portion of the site. Miller Diversion Dam, eight miles downstream, was also completed in 1925. The reservoir stores the flow of the headwater streams in the Miller Creek drainage basin and releases water in the dry summer season to irrigate 17,400 acres in the Langell Valley. Prior to reaching the Langell Valley, Miller Creek cuts across the Goodlow Rim to the southwest, a picturesque low butte of igneous rock.</p>
<p>The drainage basin of Gerber Reservoir is primarily under supervision of the Bureau of Land Management and consists of a mixture of rangeland and forest. Included within the basin are several other small reservoirs, including Strawberry and Round Valley. The shoreline of Gerber Reservoir is entirely in federal ownership. A popular warm water fishery attracts anglers throughout the year, although spring is the best season for fishing. Crappies and perch account for most of the catch, but there are also bass and rainbow trout. Two campgrounds and a number of boat launching sites are provided by the B.L.M.</p>
<p>Characteristic of reservoirs, the impoundment exhibits a dendritic, or branching shape; it contains one large island. Very few macrophytes have been observed living in the shallow arms of the reservoir. The concentrations of ions are low; calcium and sulfate have a relatively high concentration, indicating the influence of sedimentary rock weathering in the drainage basin. The reservoir is deep enough to develop thermal stratification, and there is measurable depletion of oxygen in the deeper water following stratification. Phosphorus concentration in the water is well above average and transparency is limited due to the combined effect of phytoplankton and suspended inorganic particulate matter. Productivity is high and, in combination with all other indicators, gives a classification of eutrophic.</p>

"Toketee Lake","278","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Toketee Lake is a small, relatively shallow reservoir formed by the damming of the North Umpqua River just upstream from Toketee Falls. The lake takes its name from the Falls, the word Toketee being a Chinook jargon word for pretty or graceful. This water resource project is part of the North Umpqua Power Project which includes Lemolo Lake and its power generating facility. Public recreation is an important auxiliary purpose and the Forest Service has provided a campground and a paved boat ramp. The lake is stocked each year with rainbow trout and also supports brown trout and a few eastern brook. The drainage basin for Toketee Lake is that of the entire North Umpqua River, which includes Lemolo Lake and Diamond Lake. It is primarily forest land, administered by the Rogue River National Forest.</p>
<p>The depth of Toketee Lake varies considerably as it is drawn down for power generation and for most of the year it is quite shallow. At the time this bathymetric map was constructed, the maximum depth was about 32 feet, with much of it less than 10 feet, especially in the large open northeast end of the lake where the North Umpqua River enters. The concentrations of ions, the alkalinity, and the conductivity are average for reservoirs in the southern Oregon Cascades, but the concentration of phosphorus is relatively high. Detailed studies at Diamond Lake, upstream, indicate that the surface runoff in the region contains naturally high concentrations of phosphorus. Nevertheless, the low concentration of chlorophyl and high water transparency indicate mesotrophic conditions, but close to oligotrophic. Only a weak tendency to develop thermal stratification has been noted and the water is generally saturated with oxygen at all depths. It is likely that the relatively high flushing rate (short retention time) of this impoundment inhibits the development of algae in the water; however, there are extensive growths of submerged macrophytes over most of the lake bottom.</p>

"Heavenly Twin Lakes","209","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;The Heavenly Twin Lakes are two of five closely grouped alpir lakes situated at about 6000 feet elevation in the southern Oregon Cascades. They lie at the heart of the Sky Lakes Area, a <em>de facto</em> wilderness which straddles the Cascade crest and is administered jointly by the Rogue River National Forest and the Winema National Forest. The area is currently under consideration for inclusion in The Nations Wilderness Preservation System. Such a designation for this idyllic region of 116,343 acres would ensure the continuation of the wilderness characteristics that make it so appealing. The natural environment is beautiful; glaciers and volcanic activity have both left their marl clearly on the landscape. More than 200 water bodies, ranging from met ponds to shallow lakes of 30 to 40 acres, are scattered across the terrain, all a legacy of the ice sheets that covered the mountains thousands of years ago. A number of volcanic peaks dominate the skyline. Vegetation of the area is a typical coniferous forest composed of a variety of species including mountain hemlock, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce at higher elevations and species of pine at lower elevations.</p>
<p>The Heavenly Twin Lakes are the destination of one of the more popular trails into the Sky Lakes Area, a three and one-half mile hike from Cold Springs Campground. Big Heavenly Twin Lake is 22 acres in surface area and very shallow; its average depth is less than six feet and its maximum depth about ten feet. The smaller lake is only about five acres in size, but is deeper. No permanent surface drainage has developed in this youthful summit topography; thus, there are no streams flowing into or out of the lakes. Groundwater movement predominate with subsurface seepage in the permeable volcanic rock. All lakes in this group contain brook trout and rainbow trout. Big Heavenly is a particularly good fly-fishing lake because of its shallow depth Several nice, undeveloped campsites are located around all the lakes in the group.</p>
<p>The data presented in this report are for Big Heavenly Lake, but the observations are valid for other lakes in this cluster, since they all have similar characteristics. Water in the lake has very low concentrations of all major ions, and low alkalinity. Phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations are also low, and the lake is clearly oligotrophic. Water transparency is high and the bottom of the lake is everywhere clearly visible. Because the lake is shallow, the water temperature approaches 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celcius) in late summer, in spite of its relatively high elevation.</p>

"Munsel Lake","104","<p>
<p>(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). Munsel Lake is the last in a chain of four lakes on the central Oregon coast that lies on the North Florence dunal aquifer. The aquifer is an important source of domestic water supply for the Florence area. Unlike the other three lakes in the chain - Collard Lake, Clear Lake and Ackerly Lake - Munsel Lake is also important as a recreational area and is used for fishing, swimming and boating.</p>
<p>The geologic origin of all these lakes is similar and is detailed in the earlier report on Clear Lake in this volume. In brief, the dunal aquifer, formed by the accumulation of aeolian (wind-blown) sand, lies on a down-warped marine terrace extending from Coos Bay to Heceta Head. The dune sheet is broad and relatively flat and is composed of successive layers of sand that were built up as deflation plains behind eastward migrating sand dunes. Munsel Lake and the others in this string lie along the eastern margin of this dune sheet, a result of the migration of sand eastward toward the impermeable bedrock of the Coast Range. As the migrating dunes approach the hills the wind loses its ability to transport sand and the largest portion of the sand remains to the west, thus leaving a depression or series of troughs along the base of the hills. The north-south ridge extending from Herman Peak to Siuslaw Bay is thus coincident with the series of lakes. Munsel, Clear, and Collard Lakes are therefore a result of marginal ponding by dune masses, a mode of formation typical of many other lakes on the Oregon coast (Cooper 1958).</p>
<p>The sands of the North Florence dunal aquifer are very permeable, as indicated by the lack of any substantial amount of surface drainage. No streams originate on the sands, in spite of annual precipitation of more than 60 inches. Sutton Creek and the Siuslaw River, the two major streams that cross the area, derive most of their flow from the foothills of the Coast Range to the east; the aquifer also discharges water directly into them. The main internal surface drainge originates at Collard Lake and flows through a small stream to Clear Lake. Clear Lake water flows by a surface stream to Ackerly Lake, to Munsel Lake and on out Munsel Creek. This creek leaves the northwest corner of the lake and flows in a southerly direction, discharging into Siuslaw Bay at Florence. Seasonally, surface streams do not flow out of Clear or Munsel Lakes; but within a mile, Munsel Creek begins to flow as a result of influent groundwater and this flow increases steadily culminating in an average annual discharge of about 3000 acre-feet. Munsel Creek exhibits an unusual seasonal flow regime because of the nature of its drainage basin. Fall precipitation is held back because of the high infiltration rates and high storage capacity in the dunal areas and because of ponding in the upper lakes, so that the surface stream does not attain high flows until late November. During winter and spring discharge is greater and more uniform than in other streams of comparable size.</p>
<p>Munsel Lake is deeper than most of the coastal lakes, with a maximum depth of 71 feet. The north, east, and south slopes of the lake basin abut the foothills of the Coast Range and are quite steep both above and below the water surface. The west side is flatter because it is influenced by sand dune development, and it has a gently sloping bottom covered with sand. Patches of emergent macrophytes such as water shield, bullrush, and waterlily cover the extensive shoal area along the west shore. Fallen conifers litter the shoreline on the other three sides. There is a small, marshy area adjacent to the northeast shoreline which has been artificially filled to some extent. The deeper parts of the lake are covered with organically enriched sediments.</p>
<p>Munsel Lake is important locally for recreational use and as a supply of water for domestic use. The City of Florence also maintains a small water right for emergency use. The shoreline of the lake is almost entirely in private ownership, and about 40 percent of it is developed (Bryant et al 1979). Heaviest development has been on the west side of the lake where there are several summer homes and permanent dwellings. A county boat ramp is located at the southeast corner of the lake and can be used to launch small, hand-carried craft. Nearby is a private resort with rental boats and other supplies. Primary users of the lake are early season trout anglers. There is a good population of native cutthroat trout and the lake is stocked regularly with rainbow trout by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife; however, because the tributary streams have sandy bottoms, trout are unable to spawn. Good sized largemouth bass and several other warm water species are also taken by anglers. Although fishing is generally good, the level of use is not high. Dense brush restricts the amount of shoreline available for bank fishing to a stretch of about 200 yards near the boat ramp.</p>
<p>The water quality in Munsel Lake is quite good. Characteristic of coastal lakes in Oregon, the concentrations of major ions, the alkalinity, and the conductivity are quite low. Total phosphorus and chlorophyl concentrations, water transparency, and the species and density of phytoplankton present all suggest that the lake ismesotrophic, but very close to oligotrophic. There is a tendency for oxygen depletion in the deeper water and Kavanaugh (1973) and Bryant et al (1979) reported an anoxic, oxygen-depleted hypolimnion in September. The explanation for this may lie, in part, with the morphometry of the lake basin and the locations of inflow and outflow; water may have some tendency to bypass the deep part of the basin on the east side. Also, it is a relatively deep lake in comparison with surface area, and it is somewhat sheltered from the wind; these factors would limit the effects of wind mixing. A third reason for the oxygen depletion may be related to the fact that water in Munsel Lake is somewhat warmer than in other nearby lakes, because it is the last in a hydrologic series of lakes.</p>
<p>As noted, there are a few macrophytes scattered around the littoral area of Munsel Lake, but no extensive beds have developed as they have in many other coastal lakes. Skeesick (1965) reported sparse stands of Brasenia, Potamogeton, Nuphar, and Scirpus. A plankton sample collected on 6/12/73 (Kavanaugh 1973) included Dinobryon sertularia, Peridinium cinctum, Asterionella formosa, Tabellaria fenestrata, Tabellaria flocculosa, and Melosira in the phytoplankton, with Keratella cochlearis and Kellicottia longispina in the zooplankton. The apparent difference in phytoplankton species between the 1973 sample (net plankton) and the 1981/1982 samples (nannoplankton) reported here is probably not as large as it appears due to the use of different sampling techniques. Most of the dominant nannoplankton species (Cyclotella stelligera, Rhodomonas minnta, and others) are small enough to escape through a net. Also, Dinobryon sertularia, Asterionella formosa, and Peridinium cinctum were found in some of the nannoplankton samples, but at very low densities.</p>

"Willow Valley Reservoir","291","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Willow Valley Reservoir is a relatively large irrigation reservoir just north of the California border in the southeast portion of the Klamath Basin. In spite of its primary purpose of storing water for downstream irrigation, it has become well known locally for its outstanding bass fishing. Largemouth bass taken here are reported to average better than a foot long, some weighing as much as four pounds.</p>
<p>The reservoir was constructed about 1920 with a dam across the East Branch of Lost River and it collects the drainage from an area of about 59 square miles of high semi-arid rangeland. Most of the land in this area is administered by the Bureau of Land Management and is open to the public. No camping facilities are available at the reservoir.</p>
<p>Water in the reservoir contains concentrations of major ions that are typical for eastern Oregon reservoirs; pH is slightly higher than neutral. The water column develops thermal stratification in summer and there is some oxygen depletion in the deeper water. Chlorophyl concentration is above average, and phosphorus concentration is well above average. Transparency is limited due to the presence of planktonic algae and suspended sediment. A bloom of <em>Melosira granulata</em> was observed on 7/7/82 as well as the blue-green alga <em>Anabaena spiroides</em> and the flagellate <em>Ceratium hirundinella</em>. Very little macrophyte growth is found, possibly because of the poor transparency. &nbsp;By all indications, Willow Valley Reservoir is distinctly eutrophic.</p>

"Detroit Lake","66","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Detroit Lake is a large storage reservoir on the North Fork of the Santiam River, one of 13 multipurpose, water resource projects in the Willamette River basin constructed and operated by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. The project became operational in 1953, at the same time as Big Cliff Lake, a reregulating reservoir (surge basin) immediately downstream from Detroit Lake. Detroit Lake was intended primarily for flood control and power generation, but the large reservoir has become one of the major recreation resources in western Oregon. Nearly half a million people visit each year, most of them coming during the busy summer months when high water levels are maintained. It is a beautiful, nine-mile long impoundment which twists its way through the western slopes of the Cascade Mountains below Mt. Jefferson. Three main arms branch off the main stem, and the flooded tributaries reach deeply into the mountainous and forested terrain. Shoreline slopes are quite steep and, as a result, very little land around the lake is suited for development. There are several patches of private land on these slopes. The town of Detroit, from which Detroit Lake derives its name (many Michigan people have lived in the area), lies on the shoreline where the Breitenbush River joins the lake.</p>
<p>The lower portion of the drainage basin consists of andesite lava flows mixed with ash beds, all deeply incised and dissected by stream action. Some slope failure has occurred in parts of the basin but turbidity has not been a problem as in some other area reservoirs (for example, Hills Creek Lake). A granitic intrusion, a fairly uncommon rock type for this part of the state, crops up by Detroit Dam. It is a mass of andesitic magma that did not reach the surface and cooled more slowly at depth. Possibly it represents the core of an old volcano that fed the surrounding volcanoes during the buildup of the Cascades about 25 million years ago. Most of the large drainage basin is covered with a coniferous forest managed by the Willamette National Forest. Douglas fir is the dominant species in the lower portion of the drainage basin, grading into hemlock and true firs at the higher elevations.</p>
<p>Fishing leads the list of recreational activities at Detroit Lake, with an estimated 100,000 angling-days and a catch of 200,000 fish per year. About 85 percent of the catch is rainbow trout; these are stocked in large numbers by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, with legal-size and fingerlings added monthly in summer. Piety Knob, a large island rising 450 feet from the center of the reservoir, is adjacent to a favorite trolling area. Brook trout, cutthroat trout, kokanee, and bullhead supplement the trout fishery, and chinook salmon have occasionally been stocked. Since the 463-foot high concrete dam presents an effective barrier to migrating adult salmon and steelhead, these fish are intercepted six miles downstream at Minto Station. Eggs are artificially fertilized here and taken upstream to Marion Forks Hatchery, where the fingerlings are released. Unfortunately, the Minto facility has failed to attract sufficient numbers of chinook because of low-temperature hydropower releases from Detroit Lake which tend to hold water temperatures well below the optional temperature range for chinook</p>
<p>migration (Larson 1980). Detroit Lake also receives some of the heaviest pleasure boating use in the state. Based on the total number of boating days estimated for 1975, this was the third ""most used"" lake in the state, following coastal Tenmile Lake and Diamond Lake (Frenkel 1975). Five boat ramps and two marinas help make it a very popular water-skiing spot. One campground, located on Piety Knob, can be reached only by boat. Three other campgrounds, including the large Detroit State Park on the north shore, provide over 200 tent and trailer spots around the lake. Two marinas in town offer boat rentals, moorage, and other accommodations.</p>
<p>The water level in Detroit Lake varies throughout the year, a pattern typical of other storage impoundments in the Willamette Valley. It is a response to seasonal patterns of precipitation and'runoff, and also to downstream requirements and power demands. From 1 December until 31 January, which is the major flood period, the volume of water is about one-half the maximum to allow for storage of flood waters. During late winter and spring, surface runoff fills the reservoir to near capacity, except during drier years. Until August, it is kept at a fairly constant high level, coincident with the recreation season. August through November is the season during which the water is gradually drawn back down to the minimum flood control elevation. This minimum level is 100 feet below full pool elevation and the surface area of the lake is about one-half of the area at full pool. In fall, the released water is used primarily for power production, and two generator units provide 100 megawatts of peak electrical output.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detroit Lake develops a pronounced thermal stratification with surface water as warm as 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) in the summer, whereas water temperature below 100 feet does not exceed 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius). Major ion concentrations arelow, as is characteristic of Cascade reservoirs, and oxygen is near saturation at all depths. Chlorophyl concentrations and water transparency indicate that the lake is mesotrophic or moderately productive. The concentration of phosphorus suggests that the lake is eutrophic; however, the lake is quite deep and the phosphorus in the lake evidently does not stimulate eutrophic conditions. Overall, Detroit Lake is mesotrophic, although at the low end. There is no evidence of cultural enrichment from the high amount of recreational use. The phytoplankton is composed primarily of four algal species. <em>Rhodomonas minuta</em> was always dominant in the samples collected in 1982; its occurrence is not associated with any particular trophic state. <em>Fragilaria crotonensis</em>, and to a lesser extent <em>Anabaena</em>, are common, and both indicate mesotrophic to eutrophic conditions. <em>Cryptomonas erosa</em> does not indicate any trophic state, as it is equally common in oligotrophic to eutrophic lakes. The total phytoplankton densities are typical of mesotrophic lakes.</p>

"Marion Lake","98","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985).Marion Lake is located near the western edge of the spectacular Mt. Jefferson Wilderness, and it is the largest lake in Oregon not accessible by automobile. Indeed, with the exception of massive Waldo Lake it is the largest natural lake in the Willamette National Forest on the west slope of the Central Cascades. Throughout this portion of the Cascades are found hundreds of lakes. Most of those in the Willamette National Forest lie within heavy stands of timber and thus have low visibility. Many are remote and reached only by trail. The geologic history of the Cascades accounts for an abundance of lakes in the high country, in contrast to the relative scarcity in lower elevations near the Willamette Valley. At lower elevations there are steep canyons where the activity of streams has been little altered by lava flows or glacial activity. At higher elevations, the slopes are generally less steep and both glacial and volcanic processes have been significant in recent geologic times. Glacial basins have been scoured out and many streams and rivers have been dammed by glacial moraines and lava flows to form lakes. Much of this activity has been recent enough that there has been insufficient time for water to erode the outlet barriers of the lakes.</p>
<p>Marion Lake lies in a deep, glacially scoured basin. Maximum depth is approximately 185 feet and there is little fluctuation in water level throughout the year. Surface inflow is from a number of small streams, the principal one being Eight Lake Creek which enters at the eastern end. Outflow is into Marion Creek, a tributary of the North Santiam River which is joined about seven miles downstream. Maximum relief in the 14 square mile drainage basin is about 2000 feet and slopes are moderate. There are a variety of land cover types, including a fir-hemlock forest, lava fields, marshland, and more than a dozen lakes and ponds.</p>
<p>Marion Lake has long been one of the most popular back-country lakes in Oregon, even in the days when it could be reached only by a long overland hike from the railroad terminus in Detroit. Since completion of the Santiam Pass Highway, only a short two-mile hike is needed from the end of a Forest Service road. The lake is stocked annually with rainbow trout and there is a natural reproduction of brook trout and cutthroat trout. Although the rate of catch is generally not large, there are many stories of large fish that have come from this lake. Certainly many people are drawn to the lake simply for the wilderness setting and the tranquillity it offers. Backpackers can find many unimproved campsites along the shoreline. Unfortunately, the shoreline environment suffers to some degree from overuse in the most popular areas. Marion Lake was named in 1874 by the Marion County road viewing party under the leadership of John Minto. Marion County, in turn, had been named for General Frances Marion of Revolutionary War fame.</p>
<p>The various indicators of trophic state for Marion Lake are not consistent: the relatively transparent water (Secchi disk depth = 19.7 to 22.3 feet; 6.0 to 6.8 meters) indicates oligotrophic to mesotrophic condition; total phosphorus concentrations (0.033 mg/1) are typical of mesotrophic to eutrophic lakes; and the presence of blooms of blue-green algae (<em>Anabaena</em>) signifies eutrophic conditions.<span style=""white-space: pre;"">	</span>These apparent</p>
<p>inconsistencies between physical, chemical, and biological characteristics are also found in Suttle Lake, Odell Lake, and Diamond Lake. All of these lakes are located in mountainous regions, all have similar morphometric characteristics due to their mode of origin, and all have a source of phosphorus from their respective drainage basins. The phosphorus entering Marion Lake is probably from natural sources; there are extensive marshy areas just upstream from the primary inlet. On 9/1/82 a high phosphorus concentration in the inlet water (0.069 mg/1) was measured. It is doubtful that human activities are sufficient to contribute appreciable amounts of phosphorus. As far back as the 1930s dense algal blooms were observed in the lake (Ziesenhenne 1937). This was prior to the time of much human activity in the drainage basin, thereby supporting the idea of a natural phosphorus source. Major ion concentrations are slightly higher than in other Cascade lakes; their source is probably the same as the phosphorus source (conductivity in the inlet water was 47 umhos/cm, and in the lake was 39 umhos/cm).</p>
<p>The high phosphorus concentration supports a blue-green algal bloom (<em>Anabaena flos-aquae</em>) each summer. As noted, these blooms have occurred over the past 45 years and are a natural event in Marion Lake. The density of <em>Anabaena</em> is sufficient to give the water a greenish cast, and in certain areas of the lake where the wind concentrates the algae, the lake surface appears to be covered with ""green paint"". These algae drive the pH up to values as high as 9. It is interesting to note the presence of <em>Cyclotella stelligera</em>, which was dominant on 8/5/82.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although numerically dominant, this diatom is very small, and <em>Anabaena</em> contributed more biomass than did <em>Cyclotella</em>. <em>Cyclotella stelligera</em> is associated with oligotrophic lakes (such as Bull Run Lake, Woahink Lake, and Clear Lake near Florence in this survey), whereas <em>Anabaena </em>occurs in more eutrophic lakes.</p>
<p>Marion Lake develops thermal stratification but the limited data available indicate a rather gradual decrease in temperature with depth, rather than a well mixed surface layer (epilimnion) overlying a thermocline where the temperature drops sharply with depth. There is significant oxygen depletion in the bottom waters (hypolimnion) resulting from the algal bloom (decomposition of algal cells that have settled into the hypolimnion). Overall, Marion Lake is classified as mesotrophic. The high phosphorus concentrations observed would normally create a higher trophic state, but it appears that the biological productivity is limited by physical characteristics (cool water, incomplete stratification) and only a mesotrophic condition can be achieved.</p>

"Green Lakes","233","<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985)  The Green Lakes are a group of three glacial lakes in the northern section of the Three Sisters Wilderness nestled directly between South Sister and Broken Top. The reason for the name is obvious when they are viewed from above: the color is a lovely, deep green. Middle Green Lake, the larger of the three, is 83 acres in size and lies at an elevation of 6505 feet above sea level. Upper Green Lake, the second largest of the group, is about 10 acres in size, and lies directly north of the main lake. Lower Green Lake is the smallest, about three acres, and is the first one seen by hikers who approach the area via the Fall Creek Trail from the Cascade Lakes Highway.
The Green Lakes area is one of the most popular destinations for hikers in the Central Oregon Cascades, and tents are scattered around the lakes throughout the short summer season. The area serves as a base for climbers on their way to the top of South Sister or Broken Top. Anglers find both native brook trout and rainbow trout in Middle Green Lake, and mostly the former in the smaller lakes. The wilderness quality of the area is now assured, but in 1915 the Green Lakes were investigated as a possible source of irrigation water for use on land east of Sisters. A dam, 20 feet high, would have stored 7500 acre feet of water. However, nothing ever came of the plan.
An extensive lava field, the Newberry Flow on the lower southeast slope of South Sister, is responsible for the formation of the lakes, having blocked drainage from snowmelt runoff. Two streams off the slopes of South Sister contribute to Middle Green Lake. Fall Creek, the outlet stream, has cut a channel around the east side of the lava flow, and drops 1000 feet in five miles before discharging into Sparks Lake. The drainage basin of Middle Green Lake is about 2.7 square miles and has extensive areas of white pumice supporting a sparse cover of alpine vegetation, low grasses, and wildflowers. Clusters of mountain hemlock and fir are found on the higher ridges.
Middle Green Lake consists of a single deep central basin. There are shoal areas at the ends of the lake and in the vicinity of several small tributaries. Because of the high elevation of this lake, the water remains unusually cool, with temperatures seldom exceeding 550 Fahrenheit (120 Celsius), even at the surface. The water has a very low concentration of minerals; the concentrations of ions, alkalinity and conductivity are low. The concentrations of chlorophyl and phosphorus are also low, and the water is very transparent. The lake is oligotrophic.</p>","17070301005181","","149197827","01143038","Green Lakes","1"
"Sparks Lake","265","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Sparks Lake is a picturesque lake east of the crest of the Cascade Range, lying along the much travelled Cascade Lakes Highway. It is perhaps best known for the spectacular view it provides of South Sister, which rises nearly 5000 feet above the lake to the north. It lies also in the shadow of the symmetrical slope of Bachelor Butte. Sparks Lake was named for ""Lige"" Sparks, a pioneer stockman in Central Oregon. A wagon road from Bend to the lake was completed in 1920 and resulted in greatly increased visitor use. It is a water body popular with fishermen and canoeists who like to explore the various shallow inlets. Motors are allowed for travelling on the lake, but fishing while the motor is operating is illegal. Eastern brook trout and rainbow trout are stocked and will occasionally grow as large as 16 inches. A nice Forest Service campground is available just off the highway, adjacent to Soda Creek.</p>
<p>Sparks Lake is a shallow remnant of a larger and deeper lake which has now nearly filled in with sediment and encroaching vegetation. Although the surface area is fairly extensive in spring and early summer, most of it is less than two feet deep and the maximum depth is only about seven feet. The spring runoff period is when the surface area is greatest and water spreads over low-lying marsh areas. Toward the end of the summer the lake shrinks again, leaving acres of green meadowland as pasture for cattle. A low dam at the outlet now maintains summer water level at a higher level than under the natural regime and the Forest Service and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife recently plugged leaks in the lava to reduce seepage loss. The marshy surroundings originally provided habitat for many waterfowl, but the numbers appear to have declined in the last few decades. Several surface streams drain into Sparks Lake: Goose Creek, fed by glaciers on South Sister; Fall Creek, emanating from the alpine Green Lakes; and Soda Creek, fed in part by Soda Springs and in part by glaciers on the south side of Broken Top. On 10/7/66 a glacial moraine, holding back the water in an alpine lake at the foot of Crook Glacier on Broken Top, broke and sent an estimated 50 million gallons of water down Soda Creek. Flood waters carried mud, logs, and boulder debris across the Cascade Lakes Highway and into Sparks Meadow. About 40 percent of the meadow was covered by silt and an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 tons of sediment were deposited.</p>
<p>Water in Sparks Lake is low in dissolved ions and alkalinity. It is very clear, but the lake is much too shallow to allow a Secchi disk measurement of transparency. Phosphorus concentration is moderate, but there are no algal blooms. Sparks Lake is distinctly oligotrophic.</p>

<p style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Woahink Lake is a large, deep, clear lake located about three miles inland from the central Oregon coast, directly south of the city of Florence. The lake is popular for boating, swimming and fishing. Fish species include yellow perch, largemouth bass, rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, kokanee, and coho salmon. Woahink Lake’s primary recreational access is through Jessie C. Honeyman State Park. This 522-acre park covers about 15 percent of the lake' shoreline and contains developed recreational areas and natural areas. An endangered species of pitcher plant&nbsp;<em>(Darlingtonia californica)</em>&nbsp;grows in the bog areas within the park. Much of the remainder consists of private lakeside residences.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">The lake basin owes its origin to the periods of submergence and emergence of the coastal zone that accompanied the latter stages of the Pleistocene Epoch (Cooper 1958). During periods of submergence, coastal streams were inundated by the higher sea level. Subsequent migration of sand dunes across the mouths of the streams as ocean levels decreased created impoundments. The current water surface of Woahink Lake is 38 feet above mean sea level, and the bottom at its deepest point is 74 feet deep, or about 36 feet below sea level, the lowest of any of the sand-dune dammed lakes on the Oregon coast. Tributaries feed three large arms from the north and east; the longest of the three is only about three miles in length. The lake empties southward into adjacent Siltcoos Lake via Woahink Creek.</p>

<p style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Woahink Lake’s watershed is 1784 hectares with 16.8 percent covered by the lake itself. More than half of the watershed is covered with conifer and hardwood forests. The eastern shoreline of the lake abuts the forested foothills of the Coast Range. The remainder consists of residential areas within the City of Dunes City, non-forested vegetation, and a small percentage of sand dunes and urban areas. The sand dunes in the watershed are the edge of a large active dune area to the southwest within the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. Urban areas within the watershed are located along highway 101, a major north south arterial. Road density is similar to that of other watersheds near the central Oregon coast. Average precipitation, nearly 80 inches per year, is typical of the Oregon coast area.</p>

<p style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Woahink Lake exhibits the characteristic dendritic, or branching, pattern of an impounded water body. The southern half of the lake is has large areas deeper than 15 meters. The deepest point measured in the lake during the summer of 2000 was 22.8 meters. The northern portion of the lake consists of three relatively shallow arms with extensive areas less than ten meters deep. The mean depth for the entire lake is 11.4 meters.</p>

<p style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Warm temperatures and strong winds keep Woahink Lake's surface layer mixed down to approximately 10 m during the summer. &nbsp;Since the lake does not freeze over during the winter, the lake is well mixed from the Fall through Spring. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Water quality data has been regularly collected by the City of Dunes City since the early 1990's and others. &nbsp;Secchi disc transparency, chlorophyll a concentrations, and total phosphorus concentrations indicate that the lake has been consistenly oligotrophic to mesotrophic. Hypolimnetic oxygen depletion has also been noted.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Macrophytes are present in low densities in shallow portions of the lake. Parrotfeather&nbsp;<em>(Myriophyllum aquaticum)</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Elodea canadensis</em>&nbsp;are two abundant non-native invasive species. Other species present include&nbsp;<em>Brasenia shcreberi, Nuphar polysepala, Nymphaea odorata, Valisineria americana, Utricularia vulgaris, Utricularia spp., Potamogeton spp., Myriophyllum spp., Scirpus spp., Isoetes spp., Najas spp., Chara spp.,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Juncus supiniformis.</em></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.2em;"">Although the water quality of Woahink Lake appears to be in good shape, there are concerns that further development of the watershed and the introduction of non-native invasive species pose significant threats.</p>

"Tahkenitch Lake","128","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Tahkenitch Lake is one of the larger lakes on the Oregon coast with a surface area of 1674 acres. The name is from an Indian word that is said to mean ""many arms."" In fact, the shape of the lake is dendritic, or branching, a shape which reflects its origin as a sand dune-dammed water body. As with Siltcoos Lake immediately to the north and with many other lakes of the region, Tahkenitch Lake was formed as a result of fluctuating sea level during and after the Pleistocene Epoch. The coastal area was submerged during the post-glacial rise in sea level and the lower reaches of coastal streams were drowned by the rising waters. Larger rivers, the nearby Umpqua for example, now have large estuaries as a result of the inundation of their lower reaches. On the smaller streams, the outlets became very sluggish and unable to keep their mouths free from drifting sand dunes and from their own sediments. The larger coastal lakes, including Tahkenitch, have formed where sand barriers succeeded in completely blocking the former stream mouths, impounding water behind the sand dune dams. Thus, large freshwater lakes were formed at levels which are higher than today's lower sea level (Cooper 1958).</p>
<p>One result of the mode of formation is that the lake has an extremely long shoreline (25.5 miles) with arms extending up tributary valleys. Fivemile Creek is the major stream entering the lake and Leitel Creek is another sizeable stream entering at Mallard Arm. Several other small streams also drain into the lake. Most of the lake is shallow: the mean depth is 10.9 feet; maximum depth is 23 feet; and 36 percent of the lake is less than 10 feet deep. There are two large freshwater marshes where Fivemile and Leitel Creeks enter. Leitel Marsh extends about two miles east of the lake and Fivemile Marsh about four miles; both host a rich variety of macrophytes. Outflow from the lake is at the west end through Tahkenitch Creek, which flows less than a mile through sand dunes before discharging into the ocean. The water level elevation reportedly fluctuated as much as 12 feet annually in past years; however, this has been controlled somewhat by the construction of a low dam at the outlet in 1963 by International Paper Company. The purpose of this structure and a similar one at Siltcoos Lake is to provide a year-round supply of fresh water for the company's pulp mill at Gardiner. The dam has apparently had no adverse effect on migrating fish species. Anadromous species of fish continue to pass through the lake, spawning primarily in Fivemile and Leitel Creeks. The dam has also had the beneficial effect of raising the water level, especially during summer and fall.</p>
<p>Although the drainage basin of Tahkenitch Lake is almost entirely forest land, nearly half of the land bordering the lake has been logged off and is in various stages of regrowth. Douglas fir, spruce, alder, and various types of shrubs predominate. Crown Zellerbach is the principle land holder in the immediate area and some of the upper part of the drainage basin is within the Siuslaw National Forest. Nearly the entire shoreline is in private ownership, some owned by the timber company, some by small lot owners. There are many homes around the lake. Tahkenitch Lake is probably as good a warm-water fishing lake as Siltcoos Lake, but it is not as heavily used. The main catch consists of yellow perch, catfish, and bluegill. Quite a few rainbow trout and cutthroat trout are taken early in the season and both are stocked annually. It is also a very productive largemouth bass lake, with the catch lasting well into the fall. Tahkenitch is one of the few lakes to have both smallmouth and largemouth bass. A few silver salmon and steelhead are also taken each winter. A boat is necessary for fishing as the shore is too brushy for shore access. There is one resort on the lake, adjacent to U. S. Highway 101. There is also a Forest Service campground and boat ramp near the highway and a public launch provided by Crown Zellerbach.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, greater use of Tahkenitch Lake is restricted because of a severe macrophyte problem. In the 1930s the Brazilian Water Weed, <em>Egeria densa</em>, was apparently introduced intentionally into the lake, at the same time it was introduced into Siltcoos Lake. It is as abundant as ever, despite efforts of various state agencies to control it. Tahkenitch Lake was included in the Department of Environmental Quality's 1979 report on eutrophic lakes in Oregon, and it was noted that the weed problems are similar to those in adjacent Siltcoos Lake and several other large, shallow coastal lakes which have been invaded by the Brazilian Water Weed (McHugh 1979). Repeated studies of this problem have been made by a number of public agencies and academic groups; however the problem is no nearer to solution now than it was in the beginning. For example, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife installed ""macrophyte screens"" around a fishing pier located adjacent to Highway 101 to curtail macrophyte growth and enhance fishing. However, the screens were not successful, and macrophytes are again dense near the pier. Nearly the entire bottom of the lake is covered with a dense mat of macrophytes, greatly restricting boating and swimming and presenting a nuisance to anglers. The larger lakes are extremely finefishing areas, both for warm-water fish and for trout and salmon, and would be more heavily used were it not for the weed problem. This is certainly true for Tahkenitch Lake. While the use of herbicides or weed harvesters can be used to clear small areas near resorts and similar places, semipermanent reduction of the extensive weed stands demand more general treatment. Among the possibilities are: deepening the lakes, bottom sterilization, and biological controls (McHugh 1979).</p>
<p>Aside from the macrophyte problem, water quality in Tahkenitch Lake is reasonably good. The lake is exposed to strong sea breezes and shows little tendency to stratify. Some weak stratification and oxygen depletion in the confined deeper areas has been observed on occasion, but the lake is usually unstratified and saturated with oxygen. Water transparency, chlorophyl, and phosphorus are about average for the coastal lakes, and indicate ecological conditions at the high end of mesotrophy. The water in the lake is low in mineral content and soft, and shows the characteristic enrichment with sodium and chloride of&nbsp;coastal lakes. Phytoplankton densities during summer and fall are moderate, but during the spring a diatom bloom of <em>Asterionella formosa</em> was observed. The species composition, together with their densities,&nbsp;indicate mesotrophic conditions. Most of the algae found are widespread, occurring in lakes having various trophic states; for example, <em>Anabaena</em> (eutrophic indicator) and <em>Sphaerocystis </em>(usually found in oligotrophic lakes).</p>

"Scott Lake","259","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Scott Lake is one of the many lovely, pristine mountain lakes in the Central Oregon Cascades along the McKenzie Pass Highway, an area of volcanic terrain. The setting of Scott Lake is one of the most beautiful in the Cascades. It is situated in a corridor between two wilderness areas, the Three Sisters Wilderness and the Mt. Washington Wilderness; two snowcapped volcanic peaks, the South and Middle Sisters, loom dramatically over the lake, casting their mirrored reflections onto the calm waters. Geologically recent lava flows from nearby Belknap Crater stopped short of Scott Lake, leaving a jumbled unvegetated terrain that is in striking contrast to the peaceful forest of western hemlock and the meadows that surround the lake. The name Scott was derived from Felix and Marion Scott who passed by in 1862 as they blazed a trail for the McKenzie Wagon Road. Although Scott Lake is not a particularly good fishing lake, it nevertheless attracts many people because of its beauty and its convenient starting point for trips into the wilderness. A well maintained Forest Service campground is located at the south end of the lake. It is one of the few lakes in the McKenzie Pass area that can be reached by car and is therefore better known than most of the others.</p>
<p>Very little surface drainage is generated in this volcanic region where groundwater flow dominates. No surface streams enter or leave Scott Lake. The shape of the lake is very irregular and actually consists of three separate basins connected by narrow channels. All the basins are shallow, and the mean depth of the entire lake is only 3.5 feet. The water is very low in chemical constituents, phosphorus and chlorophyl concentrations are low, and the water transparency is very high; the bottom of the lake is visible at all depths. The present status of the lake is distinctly oligotrophic. However, because of its shallow depth it would be susceptible to any nutrient additions.</p>

"Thompson Reservoir","274","<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985)  Thompson Valley Reservoir is a large irrigation impoundment located on the upper East Fork of Silver Creek in the Fremont National Forest, approximately eight miles downstream of the Silver Lake Diversion Dam. The dam and reservoir were constructed about 1930 for the Silver Lake Irrigation District. It is a shallow reservoir which, at full pool, covers an area of about 1800 acres and contains 7750 acre feet of water. Water is withdrawn for downstream irrigation through the summer and the surface area decreases considerably. In some years, the reservoir is nearly dry by September. Surface inflow to the reservoir is from a number of intermittent streams. The contributing drainage basin is covered in large part by a pine forest, and much of the area is used for grazing. Although the reservoir is within the National Forest, about half the shoreline is privately owned land.
The reservoir is stocked each spring with about 200,000 fingerling rainbow trout, and the growth rate is reportedly extremely rapid. The only other major fish species is the tui chub or roach (<em>Gila bicolor</em>), and it greatly outnumbers the trout. Fishing pressure is normally high, but the high population of rough fish has resulted in a decline of trout. Although treated periodically with rotenone, the roach quickly repopulate to the detriment of the trout. Road access to the reservoir is very good, and there are two good Forest Service campgrounds. However, because of the fish problems the facilities are not heavily used.
The water quality in Thompson Valley Reservoir is good, and it is classified as mesotrophic. The total phosphorus concentration is higher than might be expected for a mesotrophic reservoir, but a low chlorophyl concentration and high water transparency indicate low densities of phytoplankton. McHugh (1972) reported low densities of <em>Asterionella formosa</em> in the spring and low densities of <em>Ceratium hirundinella</em> and <em>Melosira granulata</em> in the summer. Macrophytes are scarce, due to extreme water level fluctuations.</p>","17120005001399","","149433072","01151112","Thompson Reservoir","4"
"Mink Lake","236","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Mink Lake, at 139 acres, is the second largest wilderness lake in the state (Marion is the largest) and one of the most remote. It lies in the southern section of the Three Sisters Wilderness, a high lava plateau area of numerous lakes, ponds, and marshes occupying pockets in the terrain. Trails come into the Mink Lake Basin from many directions, the shortest being seven miles in length. The most common route is probably from the Cascade Lakes Highway through dense forests to Blow and Doris Lakes (2 miles) and then across the Cascade Divide into the Basin. During the summer months the area is a breeding ground for hordes of mosquitoes. Nevertheless, it is a very popular backcountry destination and the effects of considerable use can be seen at the many rustic campsites along the shoreline. Eastern brook trout are taken quite regularly from the lake as are cutthroat and rainbow trout. Trails surround the lake and many other good fishing lakes are found in all directions. Because of the mosquitoes heaviest use is generally in late summer.</p>
<p>Mink Lake is relatively deep and has very little shallow water. The water in the lake is very low in chemical constituents, with a conductivity matched by only two other lakes included in this survey (Waldo Lake and Big Lake). Chlorophyl and total phosphorus concentrations and water transparency indicate that Mink Lake is among the most pristine and oligotrophic lakes in Oregon, and it is classified as ultraoligotrophic. The high elevation and confined drainage area limit the supply of nutrients to the lake. Productivity is low, and fishing is possible primarily because trout are planted in the lake. The oligotrophic nature of Mink Lake makes it vulnerable to disturbance because even small increases in nutrients may reduce water transparency.</p>

"Cleawox Lake","170","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Cleawox Lake is a very popular recreational lake on the central Oregon coast and is one of the components of the Jessie M. Honeyman State Park; Woahink Lake is the other key component of the park. The name Cleawox is certainly an Indian word but its meaning is unknown. As with many other coastal lakes Cleawox was formed by the ponding of the headwaters of a small coastal stream that was submerged during the post-glacial rise in sea level and subsequently blocked by migrating sand dunes. It is in a drainage separate from that of the adjacent Siltcoos-Woahink system. More than half of the western shore is bordered by actively advancing sand dunes that have overpassed the earlier masses responsible for the lake's impoundment. These dunes are estimated to be moving northward at 15 to 20 feet per year, gradually encroaching on the lake from this side. Inflow to Cleawox Lake is by seepage and from a few small surface streams. No surface outflow is apparent, and the regional water level varies seasonally, primarily in response to fluctuations in the water table. The drainage basin is covered with a pine and scrub complex common to this part of the Oregon coast where well-drained, sandy soils predominate.</p>
<p>Shoreline ownership around Cleawox Lake is in part federal (a two mile stretch of the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area), in part state (one mile frontage of Honeyman State Park), and the rest private. On the northeast shoreline there are several vacation homesites and a girl scout camp. The lake receives heavy recreational use in the form of swimming, canoeing and picnicking by park visitors. However, fishing pressure is light. Warm water species are present in relatively small numbers, and rainbow and cutthroat trout are planted annually. There is no overnight camping at the lake itself, but a large state park campground is located a few hundred yards south of the lake.</p>
<p>Cleawox Lake is slightly saltier than most other coastal lakes. Nevertheless, it is among the most transparent of all the coastal lakes; thus, it is classified as oligotrophic. Phytoplankton found in the lake are associated with both mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes. The flagellate Dinobryon sertularia was the dominant form found when sampling the lake on 8/16/82. The presence of mayflies also suggests more oligotrophic conditions. Because it is a shallow lake, there is an extensive growth of macrophytes on the bottom, except on the west side where the sand dunes are actively intruding on the shoreline. With a continued increase in use of the lake and an increasing number of septic tanks associated with the development of real estate on the northeast shore, it is likely that Cleawox Lake will become progressively more eutrophic.</p>

"McKay Reservoir","100","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). McKay Dam and Reservoir are located on McKay Creek about seven miles above its confluence with the Umatilla River. The reservoir was developed by the Bureau of Reclamation to furnish a supplementary supply of water to the Stanfield and Westland Irrigation Districts. McKay Dam was originally constructed during 1923-27. It is an earthfill structure, 165 feet high, and impounds a maximum of 70,000 acre feet of water which cover 1316 acres. The Bureau of Reclamation began as early as 1903 to determine the feasility of irrigating lands along the lower Umatilla River. Their studies resulted in the construction of Cold Springs Dam and Reservoir (1906-08) and the establishment of the Umatilla Project. In 1923, construction was started on McKay Dam and Reservoir and was completed in 1927. The Westland Irrigation District was formed to cooperate with the Bureau of Reclamation in utilizingwater stored in McKay Reservoir. Later, the Stanfield Irrigation District was organized to negotiate with the Bureau for storage in McKay Reservoir. The Umatilla Project now consists of three divisions, and furnishes a full supply of irrigation water to 17,348 acres and asupplemental supply to 13,235 acres. The Stanfield and Westland Irrigation Districts, which receive water from McKay, are in the South Division. The Stanfield District is on the east side of the Umatilla River near the town of Stanfield and the Westland District is west of the river near Hermiston. The Bureau of Reclamation continues to operate the reservoir, while the irrigation districts operate their own facilities, and have each contracted for a 30 percent ownership of the storage space in the reservoir. Water is released from the reservoir on request from the districts, and they operate their own canal systems (Bureau of Reclamation 1980).</p>
<p>In addition to the primary purpose of irrigation storage, McKay Reservoir provides auxiliary benefits, specifically for flood control, recreation, and fish and wildlife. McKay Dam is operated on an informal basis for flood control and greatly reduces flows that otherwise would be very damaging. Modification of the spillway section was made in 1978-79 to increase the discharge capacity. This will not prevent damaging flows downstream during an extreme flood event, but it will ensure against a catastrophic flood from dam failure. Recreation at the reservoir, particularly for fishermen, is severely limited by the extreme drawdown required by late summer. Losses of gamefish and destruction of their habitat occurs annually both here and in the Cold Springs Reservoir. The problem is more acute in McKay Reservoir because of low streamflows. There is no supplemental inflow as there is to Cold Springs Reservoir from the Umatilla River. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife stocks McKay with rainbow trout every year, but no minimum pool is guaranteed for their survival. Several times the reservoir has been chemically treated to control species of rough fish. Bass, catfish, bluegills, and crappies have also been stocked and they all provide good fishing at times. Boats can be launched, although no fishing from boats is allowed from April 1 to September 30. There are no camping facilities.</p>
<p>Both the McKay and Cold Springs Reservoir areas are natural wildlife refuges that are heavily used by migrating waterfowl. The McKay Creek National Wildlife Refuge, established in 1927, consists of 515 acres of the water surface and adjacent shoreline. It provides nesting and feeding areas for thousands of Canadian geese, mallards, sandhill cranes, and other birds. About 200 acres of wheat are planted for the waterfowl and upland game birds. The marshland at the upper end of the reservoir where McKay Creek enters is particularly used by the birds. Some 275 acres of the area have been designated as public hunting grounds.</p>
<p>Typical of most reservoirs in the semi-arid country of eastern Oregon, McKay Reservoir is distinctly eutrophic, and although the total phosphorus measurement on 6/24/82 was anomalously low (0.012 mg/1), the reservoir is well enriched with algal nutrients from several sources. As noted, McKay Creek flows through a marshy area, and is nutrient enriched. The abundant waterfowl also contribute nutrients, as does the muddy bottom of the reservoir. Very heavy blue-green algal blooms (<em>Aphanizomenon flos-aquae</em>) develop as early as late spring. On 6/24/82 the surface water temperature was 76 degrees Fahrenheit (24.4 degrees Celsius), which greatly enhances phytoplankton growth rates. On this date, the reservoir was stratified; the thermocline was located at a shallow depth of 13 feet (4 meters). The hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen was slightly less than saturation; however, later in the summer it would be expected to go anoxic. McHugh (1972) also reported an <em>Aphanizomenon flos-aquae</em> bloom in the summer, and he observed predominantly eutrophic diatoms in the winter (<em>Melosira granulata, Synedra ulna</em>). Due to large irrigation water withdrawal during summer, the reservoir area and water depths become greatly reduced, preventing extensive growth of macrophytes.</p>

"Paulina Lake","114","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Paulina Lake is one of two lakes occupying Newberry Crater, a volcanic caldera nearly five miles in diameter located at the summit of the Paulina Mountains. Paulina Lake is slightly larger in surface area and 40 feet lower in elevation than its neighbor, East Lake. It is one of many geographic features in Oregon which carries the name of a well-known, nineteenth century Snake Indian. Chief Paulina is believed to have been responsible for a number of conflicts between Indians and white settlers in eastern Oregon during the 1860s. He was killed in the summer of 1867 after raiding several ranches in the John Day country. Appropriate or not, the name is commonly used in this area: e.g., Paulina Lake in the Paulina Mountains is surrounded by the rim of the caldera whose high point is Paulina Peak. Paulina Creek is the outlet for the lake and joins the Deschutes River 15 miles downstream in Paulina Prairie.</p>
<p>Volcanic activity, similar to that which created Crater Lake, is responsible for the caldera of Newberry Crater (Williams 1953). However, there are significant differences. This is a shield type volcano, with a 20-mile base, a type which forms over ""hot spots"" where lava is flowing from deep within the earth. The volcano has more than 150 cinder cones on its flanks. After radial drainage gradually reduced support for the higher slopes, the conical shaped peak collapsed. This event is estimated to have occurred 20,000 to 25,000 years ago and explosive activity has occurred at intervals ever since, most recently about 2050 years ago. There are lava flows on the outer slopes of Newberry Volcano that may be as recent as 1000 years old.</p>
<p>Snow and ice associated with the last stages of the Pleistocene Epoch accumulated in the caldera to depths of several hundred feet, and flowing ice helped to scour the outlet from Paulina Lake which cuts through the flank of the crater (Russell 1905). Ash and lapilli from late phases of volcanic activity formed deposits that partly sealed the bed of the lake basins. It is apparent that the caldera was originally occupied by one large lake, but subsequent volcanic action built up a barrier of subsidiary cinder cones and lava flows, running north and south across the middle of the depression, to form two lakes. By the time the recent eruptions within the crater had ceased, about 2050 years ago, the two lakes were separated, and probably each was near its present water level.</p>
<p>The rim of Newberry Crater rises steeply for several hundred feet around the lakes to a high point of 7984 feet at Paulina Peak, and it has been breached only on the west side to form a perennial outlet to the Deschutes River by way of Paulina Creek. The steep slopes support a scattered forest of lodgepole pine and ponderosa pine, interspersed with some hemlocks and alders. However, much of the drainage basin is covered with bare rock.</p>
<p>The entire area of the Newberry Crater, including East Lake and its drainage basin is topographically tributary to Paulina Lake. Phillips and Van Denburgh (1968) have described the hydrologic characteristics of the two lakes. East Lake has no surface outlet and loses water entirely by evaporation from the surface and by subsurface seepage. A portion, but not all, of this seepage makes its way into Paulina Lake through the volcanic obstruction between the two lakes. Thus, surface inflow to Paulina Lake is only from the eight square mile area as noted on the attached map. There are no perennial streams, but considerable runoff during the snowmelt season. Water is lost from the lake by surface evaporation and by discharge through Paulina Creek.</p>
<p>Although East and Paulina Lakes are favorites with fishermen, both were devoid of fish until a Central Oregon sportsman packed in trout late in the nineteenth century. Since then they have been stocked by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. It is estimated now that over 60,000 anglers visit the lakes each year, although they are among the last lakes to open in the spring because of road blockage by heavy snows. Record German brown trout taken from East Lake have enhanced its reputation over Paulina Lake, but the larger lake has been a consistent producer from year to year, with good catches of rainbow trout and occasional eastern brook trout. Several campgrounds are at the lake, maintained by the Deschutes National Forest. There are a number of summer homes on land leased from the Forest Service and a private resort on the west end.</p>
<p>Paulina Lake is one of the deeper lakes in Oregon, with a mean depth of 163 feet and a maximum depth of over 250 feet. The walls of the caldera are steep, and only a very small proportion of the lake (three percent) is shallower than 10 feet, thereby restricting the growth of macrophytes to a narrow fringe around the shoreline. <em>Myriophyllum </em>and <em>Elodea</em> are common macrophytes. The lake develops a distinct thermal stratification in the summer, with a thermocline at a depth of 50 to 60 feet (15 to 18 meters). Deep water remains very cold (39 degrees Fahrenheit, 4 degrees Celsius, below 200 feet) all year, and in the winter the surface frequently ices over. Because of the high elevation of the lake and its large volume, surface water also remains cool during the summer. Maximum summer temperature of surface water is about 64 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius).</p>
<p>The water chemistry of Paulina Lake is unusual. Concentrations of major ions are very high for a lake not in an evaporation basin, and signficantly higher than the concentrations observed in nearby East Lake. Alkalinity (340 ppm) and conductivity (560 umhos/cm) are also higher in Paulina Lake than in East Lake (103 ppm; 310 umhos/cm). The concentration of sulfate, however, is much lower in Paulina Lake than in East Lake. Both lakes are strongly influenced by subsurface flow of water from hot springs which contribute much of the unusually high concentrations of ions. The presence of hot springs at East Lake is well known, but less known is the presence of hot springs at Paulina Lake, with water temperatures of 96-113 degrees Fahrenheit. These springs were discovered in 1911, but plans to establish a health resort never materialized. However, hot alkaline springs, charged with sulfur and soda and having a temperature of 120 degrees F, became the site for a resort located on the southeastern shoreline of East Lake.</p>

"Miller Lake","234","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Miller Lake, named for an early Klamath County ranching family, is a large, natural lake in an attractive mountain setting just east of the Cascade crest. It is situated in a small, densely forested drainage basin of very steep slopes. Most of the drainage basin is in the Winema National Forest, with a small part at the north end in the Deschutes National Forest. Several surface streams enter the lake and the outflow is into Miller Creek at the southeast end. Miller Creek itself terminates in Beaver Marsh about ten miles downstream. Except near the outlet, the lake is quite deep with steeply sloping sides, a further expression of the surrounding topography.</p>
<p>Miller Lake is only 20 miles northeast of Crater Lake and certainly received a heavy load of pumice and ash when Mt. Mazama exploded approximately 6,600 years ago. The drainage basin contains significant amounts of volcanic ash and other poorly consolidated volcanic material which may yet influence the chemistry of the water in spite of the heavy forest cover. Several water bodies in this area are covered by sparse stands of the water alwort Subularia aquatica, a small plant that thrives on barren volcanic ash bottoms in clear lakes at high elevations.</p>
<p>Productivity in this pristine lake is low enough to limit natural fish production. However, it is stocked regularly with rainbow trout, brook trout, and kokanee and is very popular with fishermen. In 1964 it was poisoned to kill parasitic lampreys and then restocked. With its associated water sports, good camping and picnic facilities, large area of adjacent undeveloped country and hiking trails, plus easy access to the Pacific Crest Trail, Miller Lake offers many opportunities for recreation and relaxation in a beautiful forest environment.</p>
<p>Overall, the water quality in Miller Lake is exceptionally good and it is classified as oligotrophic. The water contains low concentrations of ions. The phosphorus concentration is about average for Cascade mountain lakes, while the chlorophyl concentration and plankton populations are less than average. Water transparency is above average (29.2 feet; 8.9 meters), but still considerably less than in some nearby lakes such as Crater Lake and Lake Harriette.</p>

"Cougar Reservoir","178","<p>
<p>(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). Cougar Lake is a long, narrow multi-purpose reservoir, built by the Corps of Engineers in 1963 by damming the South Fork of the McKenzie River about three miles south of Rainbow. The lake was named Cougar because of its proximity to Cougar Creek, a small stream used to designate the dam site on preliminary surveys. At the time the rockfill dam was constructed it was the largest in Oregon. This reservoir is one of 13 multi-purpose water projects built and operated by the Corps in the Willamette Valley. Operation is primarily for flood control and hydroelectric power generation. Recreational use is, of course, important and the lake is used all year, although maximum use occurs during the early summer months. Boating and fishing pressure is heavy; the lake contains coho salmon, rainbow, cutthroat and Dolly Varden trout. Overnight camping is available at three Forest Service parks around the lake. Public use is probably less than might otherwise be the case because the steep slopes that surround the lake leave little flat land adjacent to the water. Also, as with any flood control reservoir, the late summer draw-down exposes steep mud banks which further restrict access.</p>
<p>The drainage basin is entirely within the Willamette National Forest and is an area of rugged topography and diverse forest types, typically Douglas fir and western hemlock. The shoreline is also entirely within federal ownership. Bank stabilization at Cougar Lake has been a concern for years and has been partially improved by continued application of fertilizer to the above-water areas to encourage vegetation growth. In addition, the Forest Service and Soil Conservation Service have worked together to establish vegetative cover within the drawn-down portion of the lake.</p>
<p>Major ion chemistry in Cougar Lake is typical of other Willamette Valley reservoirs. Sodium and chloride concentrations, alkalinity and conductivity are all fairly low, as are phosphorus and chlorophyl concentrations. Very few, if any, macrophytes have been observed in this deep lake. Water transparency is high relative to other water quality characteristics (Secchi disk depth = 25.3 feet; 7.7 meters), indicating lower trophic conditions. However, phytoplankton species are more typical of a higher trophic state. Overall, Cougar Lake is classified as mesotrophic.</p>

"Hosmer Lake","211","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Hosmer Lake, along the Cascade Lakes Highway in Central Oregon, was originally known as Mud Lake because the large population of trash fish would stir up the fine pumice bottom material. In 1962 the name was changed to honor Paul Hosmer, a long-time resident of Bend and a well-known amateur naturalist. The trash fish, which included a population of carp, had been eliminated with rotenone treatment in 1957. Atlantic salmon were stocked on an experimental basis starting in 1958, and Hosmer is the only lake west of the Mississippi River in which these fish have been planted successfully. All fishing must be done with barbless hooks, and Atlantic salmon must be returned to the lake. Brook trout are also in the lake, and can be kept if caught. There is little development at the lake, limited to small, rustic campgrounds and a few boats for rent.</p>
<p>Hosmer Lake is very shallow, with a mean depth of 3.2 feet and a maximum depth of 12 feet. The lake basin is long and narrow, with the main axis oriented north-south. Lava flows from Bachelor Butte were probably responsible for the formation of the lake, impounding the waters of Quinn Creek. There is some fluctuation of the water level, and in dry years there is no surface outlet. In wet years, water travels into a fissure about 50 yards downstream and disappears into the lava rock. Hosmer Lake is senescent water body, well on its way to becoming a marsh because of the encroachment of vegetation. Marshes extend into the lake, and the bottom is composed of mud and peaty deposits. The open water is restricted in many placed by mosses and submerged macrophytes; there are also extensive stands of emergent macrophytes. The lake is more productive than is usual for Cascade mountain lakes, and is classified as mesotrophic. The mineral content of the water is above average, as are the concentrations of chlorophyll and phosphorus. Water transparency is limited to about 8.2 feet (2.5 meters).</p>

"Clear Lake (168)","168","<p>
<p>(From A<em>tlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;One of eleven in the state with the same name, this Cascade mountain lake is well known as the source of the beautiful McKenzie River. It lies in forested terrain marked by numerous recent lava flows. Clear Lake is one of the most obvious examples in Oregon of a lake formed by a lava dam. About 3000 years ago hot lava, issuing from a vent in the Sand Mountain Line of craters to the east, poured across the McKenzie River, impounding its flow. The quickly-formed lake inundated a standing Douglas fir forest and dozens of snags are still located on the lake floor, partially preserved by the cold waters. This ""underwater forest"" can be seen through the remarkably clear waters and is a popular destination for boaters and scuba divers. Stream patterns in the drainage basin have been altered considerably in recent geologic times; lava has buried so many of the old river channels that much of the area is now drained by groundwater flow. Clear Lake is fed chiefly by large springs along the north and east shore; the largest of these is Big Spring, which gushes dramatically into the lake with a flow of ice cold water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clear Lake has long been an attractive recreation spot. The Santiam Fish and Game Association leases the lake from the National Forest and operates a small resort with cabins. A Forest Service campground is also available for visitor use. The Association is a sportsman's club, one of many throughout the state affiliated with the Oregon Wildlife Federation. Combined efforts of these organizations, public and private, have been instrumental in the protection of a quality recreation experience and the preservation of the resource. No motorboats are allowed on the lake. Fishing is usually good throughout the season. Both rainbow and eastern brook trout are stocked and there are some native cutthroat trout. There are apparently no trash fish in the lake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chemically and biologically, Clear Lake is unusual in a number of respects. Although the underwater trees are not ""petrified,"" decomposition has been very slow because of the low level of biological activity in the water. The lake is also unusual in having slightly higher concentrations of major ions than most other Cascade lakes. The fact that inflow is primarily from subsurface drainage in volcanic rock may account for this aspect of the water's chemistry. As the name of the lake implies, the water in the lake is very transparent (Secchi disk depth = 56 feet; 17 meters) and there is very little growth of plankton or rooted macrophytes. Chlorophyl and transparency data indicate that it is ultraoligotrophic. The total phosphorus observation is anomalously high, again perhaps due to the influence of volcanic material on spring flow. Clear Lake is rather deep and may be expected to remain ultraoligotrophic. In spite of intense recreational use, the management history makes this a reasonable expectation.</p>

"Upper Tumalo Reservoir","284","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Upper Tumalo Reservoir is a small irrigation impoundment constructed in 1913 by the Tumalo Irrigation District. Bull Creek Dam, an 82-foot high earthfill dam, impounds the seasonal runoff from a dry area on the east slope of the Cascades where the pines meet the junipers. The reservoir has a storage capacity of about 800 acre-feet, and water is released into the Tumalo Feed Canal to augment flow in Tumalo Creek. The reservoir does receive some recreational use, mainly by fishermen, but there are no facilities for visitors. However, in past years this was the site of much activity. Hatton (1980) reports that in the 1920s and 1930s Upper Tumalo Reservoir was a favorite ice skating ""rink"" for local residents. Throngs of people would drive from Bend to skate by the light of huge bonfires. In January 1926, Central Oregon's first ice hockey game was staged when the ""Polars"" and the ""Arctics"", teams consisting of men who had played in Europe, Alaska, Canada, and the midwestern United States, faced off before an enthusiastic crowd of 1500 spectators. On other occasions people skated to music from a radio which, using a juniper tree as an aerial stand, picked up a broadcast from the San Francisco Hotel.</p>
<p>The maximum depth of Upper Tumalo Reservoir is only 11 feet; thus the entire impoundment is shallow enough for macrophyte growth and vegetation covers the bottom. The concentration of minerals in the water is low; alkalinity is especially low; and the water is more acidic than average for central and eastern Oregon reservoirs. The concentration of phosphorus is a little below average, and the chlorophyl concentration is low. The water is sufficiently transparent that the bottom is everywhere visible. Based on the growth of macrophytes, the reservoir can be classified as mesotrophic, although the water chemistry characteristics would suggest more oligotrophic conditions. Net phytoplankton found in the sample collected on 7/20/82 include <em>Dinobryon bavaricum, Desmidium quadratum</em>, and <em>Asterionella formosa</em>. However, these species are not reliable indicators of trophic state.</p>

"Cottonwood Meadow Lake","176","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Cottonwood Meadow Lake is a small artificial lake, created by the U. S. Forest Service and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in 1961 with the construction of an earthfill dam on Cottonwood Creek. The lake should not be confused with Cottonwood Reservoir which is much lower on the same stream. Cottonwood Meadow Lake was constructed both to enhance irrigation by distributing downstream flows more evenly during the latter part of the growing season in July and August, and to provide recreational benefits. Rainbow trout and brook trout are stocked in the lake and fishing is good, although occasionally impaired in late summer by algal blooms. No motors are allowed on the water and it is open to fishing all year. The Forest Service has provided two small campgrounds and boat ramps.</p>
<p>This shallow, eutrophic reservoir has high phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations, high pH, limited water transparency, blue-green algal blooms, and macrophytes covering about 80 percent of the reservoir bottom; these conditions are natural and there is no evidence of contribution from the heavy recreational use that occurs in this area. By late summer, dense blue-green algal blooms (<em>Anabaena circinalis</em> and <em>Gloeotrichia echinulata</em>) become apparent and restrict use of the lake for recreation.</p>

"Crescent Lake","58","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985).(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Crescent Lake is a large natural lake lying high on the east slope of the Cascades at an elevation of 4839 feet. In 1909 its waters were reserved for irrigation purposes and the subsequent construction of a control dam at the lake's outlet by private interests raised the water level several feet. The lake now serves as the key component of the Bureau of Reclamation's Crescent Lake Dam Project which provides for irrigation of 8000 acres of land on the west side of the Deschutes River near Bend. When the Bureau of Reclamation took over the project, the original dam was removed and a new 40-foot high dam was constructed. Usable storage is 86,860 acre-feet, which is about 15 percent of the total lake volume (Bureau of Reclamation 1982). This reconstruction was begun in 1955 and completed in 1956. Rehabilitation of the associated canal and lateral system began in 1974 and was completed in 1977. The Tumalo Irrigation District operates and maintains the project.</p>
<p>Crescent Lake is one of several large, deep lakes in Oregon formed by the erosive and depositional activity of glaciers during the Pleistocene Epoch. It lies in a broad, glacially scoured valley behind a moraine dam left behind during the glacial retreat. Odell Lake nearby and Wallowa Lake in northeast Oregon are other lakes formed in the same manner. Each consists of a single deep basin, aligned with the valley, with an uncomplicated bottom topography. Crescent Lake is five miles long, four miles wide, and has a maximum depth of 265 feet. The water surface drops several feet in late summer because of irrigation withdrawals. However, because of its depth the surface lowering has very little impact on the ecology of the lake. The primary surface inflow is from Summit Lake via Summit Creek. Several small, intermittent streams contribute during the snowmelt season. Crescent Creek, a tributary of the Deschutes River, is the outlet stream. The lake and its drainage basin are entirely within the Deschutes National Forest. It is a landscape blanketed with a thick coniferous forest of both fir and pine species, except for areas of rock outcrops at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Located near a major highway, Crescent Lake receives heavy recreational use throughout the summer; the entire shoreline is accessible by road. However, only the portion paralleling the north and west shore is paved, while the east shore road is narrow and unsurfaced. Trails leading into nearby Diamond Peak Wilderness and to several small lakes to the south provide an opportunity for hiking. Picnic grounds and four Forest Service Campgrounds are available, with Crescent Lake Campground near the outlet being the largest. In addition there are over 70 recreation cabins on the northwest shore, a private resort near the outlet, and a Boy Scout Camp on the south shore. In spite of all the facilities and recreational opportunities at Crescent Lake, much of the lake's shoreline is undeveloped and the forest unaltered in keeping with Forest Service management objectives. It has become quite a good fishing lake with kokanee, lake trout, mackinaw, and whitefish. A few brown trout are also caught each year.</p>
<p>Water quality in Crescent Lake is excellent and it is distinctly oligotrophic. The lake is sometimes exposed to strong winds, which help produce a relatively deep (50 to 60 feet, 15 to 18 meters) thermocline during summer stratification. The presence of a deep, cold, well oxygenated hypolimnion provides an excellent habitat for the mackinaw trout which thrive in Crescent Lake. The mineral content of the water is low; water transparency is excellent; and the concentrations of chlorophyl and phosphorus are generally low. There is very little growth of macrophytes because of the lack of a suitable substrate. The population density of phytoplankton is low, but zooplankton populations are reported to be modest (Chapman and Fortune 1963). Phytoplankton densities (except for the sample collected from the dock in November, &nbsp;1982) indicate a trophic state between ultraoligotrophic to oligotrophic. The species present, however, are indicators of different trophic states. Certain algae (<em>Kephyrion</em>, <em>Dinobryon</em>, <em>Tabellaria</em>, and <em>Chromulina</em>) are most commonly found in oligotrophic lakes, but may also be found in mesotrophic lakes. Other algae are most commonly found in mesotrophic to eutrophic lakes (<em>Asterionella formosa</em>, <em>Fragilaria crotenensis</em>, and <em>Anabaena</em>). Although not conclusive, the presence of these eutrophic algae do indicate the possibility of impacts from cultural activities on and around the lake. The soils around Crescent Lake are very porous and have little capacity to absorb and retain nutrients. For this reason, special care has been taken in the development of recreation facilities to prevent any accidental cultural eutrophication of the lake. The water quality in Crescent Lake should be monitored in the future to detect any changes that may occur. However, to date the lake shows little evidence of eutrophication, despite considerable use (McHugh 1972).</p>

"Todd Lake","277","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Todd Lake is a small, deep lake on the east slope of the Central Oregon Cascades. The turnoff to it from the Cascade Lakes Highway is at a small meadow surrounded by lava flows which emanated from nearby Bachelor Butte. The dirt road originally continued north past the lake, but is now closed to traffic. It terminates at a parking lot about 100 yards from the lake and a short hike is necessary. Those who do walk to Todd Lake are greeted with the sight of a pristine water body, lying in a broad glacial valley; the Three Sisters form a spectacular backdrop. A coniferous forest flanks the lake on both sides and the upper end merges with a lovely, broad meadow that shows off a beautiful display of wildflowers in late summer. Snowmelt runoff from the small drainage basin supplies water to the lake; the only permanent inflowing stream is one from Bare Lake. The outlet stream cascades south and eventually disappears into the permeable volcanic terrain about two miles southwest of the lake.</p>
<p>Todd Lake was, for many years, named Lost Lake because it was difficult to find. Citizens of Bend requested the name be changed to avoid confusion with other ""Lost Lakes"" in the Cascades. Attempts to name it Lake Bend were unsuccessful, and in 1922 it was named in commemoration of John Y. Todd, a pioneer of Central Oregon who built Sherars Bridge in 1860, the first bridge across the Deschutes River.</p>
<p>Todd Lake has long been a favorite family recreation site. It provides the opportunity for campers to enjoy a wilderness experience without a long hike, and it is also popular as a day-use site. Fishing for brook trout is quite good, in part due to special regulations. No motorboats are allowed on the lake and no fishing is permitted from any floating craft. Because of these regulations, and a regular stocking program, bank angling is successful year after year; fly-fishing is particularly good.</p>
<p>Because of its depth and sheltered location, Todd Lake develops a sharp thermal stratification in the summer and remains extremely cold below a depth of 15 feet (4.6 meters). The concentrations of major ions, alkalinity, and conductivity are typical of other mountain lakes in the Cascades. Water transparency is good (Secchi disk depth = 22.7 feet; 7 meters) and the concentration of chlorophyl is low. The concentration of phosphorus observed on 8/16/82 was high, a condition typical of several other lakes near the Cascade Lakes Highway. Otherwise, all available data indicate that this small lake is oligotrophic.</p>

"Bumphead Reservoir","163","<p>(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Bumphead Reservoir is a small, shallow irrigation reservoir located in the rangeland of southern Klamath County. It was constructed in about 1950 with a 22-foot earthfill dam impounding the waters of a small region in the headwaters of the Willow Valley Reservoir drainage basin. Surface inflow is via intermittent streams from the north and the intermittent outflow is to the south into the larger Willow Valley Reservoir on the California border. The shoreline and drainage basin of Bumphead Reservoir are entirely under management of the Bureau of Land management. This is a barren landscape of sage and cheatgrass, supporting low density cattle grazing. The reservoir thus serves also as a stock watering pond. The water level fluctuates dramatically during the year due to irrigation withdrawals and it dried up completely in 1977. </p>
<p>The most interesting feature of the surrounding landscape, and the source of the reservoir's name, is The Bumpheads, two rimrock hills immediately to the east of the reservoir which stand well above the surrounding landscape. The larger eastern Bumphead slopes gently in two places allowing infrequent, but destructive, visits by cattle. The smaller Bumphead is well protected from such damage due its steep walls, and it supports a pristine herbaceous layer of Idaho fescue. Protection of these hills is strongly encouraged by the Nature Conservancy, specifically a 10-acre tract on top of the smaller, and a 40-acre tract on top of the larger. A recommendation has been made to build a short fence blocking the cattle routes, so that the native bunchgrass community can endure. </p>
<p>The high biological productivity in Bumphead Reservoir has allowed the development of a good warm water fishery, particularly for black bass and crappie. After the drought of 1976-77 restocking was necessary, but this was apparently accomplished successfully. No recreation or boat launching facilites are available and the lake is difficult to reach over rough, gravel roads; but for those who make the effort, there is usually angling success. </p>
<p>Because it is a shallow water body, Bumphead Reservoir develops no thermal stratification. The water is surprisingly low in chemical constituents for this location; the concentrations of major ions and conductivity are less than average for eastern Oregon reservoirs. The ratio of calcium to sodium ions is fairly high, indicating the influence of weathering of sedimentary rocks in the drainage basin. High phosphorus concentrations contribute to the frequent blooms of planktonic algae. On 8/10/82 a bloom of Gloeotrichia echinulata was observed. Water transparency is thus limited and the lake is definitely eutrophic.</p>","18010204002338","","84069917","01118308","Bumphead Reservoir","4"

"Beale Lake","154","<p>
<p>(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Beale Lake is one of several lakes in an extensive area of sand dunes stretching from North Bend to Florence on the Oregon coast. It is within the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area and as such is managed by the Siuslaw National Forest. Along with several other lakes in the area (including Horsfall and Saunders in this survey) it lies in a forested deflation plain on which the sand has been stabilized by a dense growth of shrubs and trees, primarily fir and pine. Active dunal ridges, reaching about 100 feet above sea level, flank the plain on both sides and trend north and south parallel to the coastline. There are no perennial streams in the area and the lake is actually a surface expression of seasonal fluctuations in the water table. Surface area, therefore, will vary considerably throughout the year. In the winter when the water table is highest, surface flow occurs in broad, undefined channels, generally out of Beale Lake and south towards Snag Lake. For much of the year the lake consists of several nearly independent basins interconnected by shallow channels. Water levels also fluctuate as withdrawals are made from the ground water aquifers for industrial use in the Coos BayNorth Bend area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the lake (85 percent on the accompanying bathymetric map) is shallower than 10 feet and there is considerable growth of both submerged and emergent macrophytes, although an active sand dune on the north shore inhibits the growth of macrophytes in that area. Sodium and chloride concentrations are slightly above average for coastal lakes in Oregon, explained by the fact that there is little shelter from the nearby ocean and influence from sea spray. However, conductivity and alkalinity are slightly below average. Because of the shallow depth of the lake and the exposure to strong winds, Beale Lake is well-mixed, does not stratify, and there is no depletion of oxygen. Phosphorus concentration is about average for coastal lakes and indicates mesotrophic ecological conditions. Water transparency is less than average because of high algal densities and possibly because of the presence of dissolved organic matter derived from numerous dead pine stumps and trunks on the lake bottom. Otherwise, the bottom of the lake is composed mainly of deep sand. Overall, Beale Lake is considered to be mesotrophic, but is close to being eutrophic. It is not likely that cultural activities will affect this status. Access for visitors is difficult and the lake thus receives minimal use.&nbsp;</p>

"Bradley Lake","1124","<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Bradley Lake is a small natural lake located on the central Oregon coast four miles south of the City of Bandon. The lake was formed during the Pleistocene Epoch by the impoundment of China Creek by migrating sand dunes, a common lake formation mode on the Oregon Coast (Cooper 1958). Several vacation and permanent homes line the forested shores of the lake. Residents and visitors boat, swim and fish in Bradley Lake. A public boat launch is maintained at the south corner and the lake is regularly stocked with rainbow trout.</p>
<p><strong>Watershed Characteristics</strong></p>
<p>The surface area of Bradley Lake covers only a small percentage of its total watershed area, 1.4%. The total watershed area is 646 hectares. Conifer and hardwood forests cover nearly 50%, urban-agriculture over 30%, and non-forested vegetation almost 20%. Sand dune areas at the western end of the lake cover less than 1% of the watershed area. The urban-agriculture areas are a mixture of housing developments, rangeland, farmland, and cranberry bogs. Non-forested vegetation areas mainly consist of marshland. Rainfall is averages about ten inched less per year than in areas to the north and south. Road density is high in comparison to other Oregon coast watersheds.
Elevations range from five meters at the outlet of the lake to 223 meters in the foothills of the Coast Range. The western half of the watershed is located on the coastal plain and has low relief while the eastern half rises abruptly into the hills. The mean slope across the entire watershed is 5.2%.
</p>
<p><strong>
Morphometry</strong></p>
<p>Bradley Lake has one main basin with two small bays extending to the northeast and southeast. The shoreline falls away steeply around most of the lake. Although the maximum depth measured is only 10.2 meters, the average depth is 7.1 meters. Shallow areas are located in the two eastern arms. A small ten-foot wide winding channel connects the main body of the lake with the boat launch in the southeast corner.</p>
<p><strong>Water Quality</strong></p>
<p>Several water quality parameters were measured in Bradley Lake during the summer of 2001by Portland State University. Bradley Lake’s trophic state based on secchi disc depth, chlorophyll a concentration, and total phosphorus concentration ranged from index values of 40 to 51. These values are within the mesotrophic range but range into the eutrophic range. Bradley Lake was completely mixed during April of 2001 and stratified during July and September of 2001 at 3.0 and 3.9 meters respectively. The shallow depth of stratification is due in part to the high color, reported as tannic acid equivalents, of the water. The color prevents much penetration of light energy into the water column and this lack of energy allows shallow stratification. The color or tannic acids are most likely a result of humic compounds transported to the lake from wetlands and cranberry bogs within the watershed.
Thick beds of the non-native invasive macrophyte <em>Egaria densa </em>cover much of the sediment in shallow areas of the lake. Other species present include <em>Typha latifolia</em>, <em>Lemna minor</em>, <em>Nuphar polysepala</em>, <em>Potomogeton natans</em>, <em>Potentilla paulstris</em>, <em>Oenanthe sarmentosa</em>, <em>Myriophyllum spp.</em>, <em>Juncus spp.</em>, and <em>Polygonium spp.</em></p>","17100306004496","","122482105","01118032","Bradley Lake","5"

"Cullaby Lake","60","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Cullaby Lake is the largest of the many lakes on the Clatsop Plains of the north Oregon coast. It was originally known as Ya-se-ya-ma-na-la-tslas-tie, but was later named for Cullaby, a well-known Indian character of the region. Cullaby had a peculiar light complexion and was reputed to be a grandson of one of the members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition that wintered nearby in 1804-05. The geologic origin of Cullaby Lake is similar to that of many others on the Oregon coast. The mouth of a coastal stream was drowned by the post-Pleistocene rise in sea level and, subsequently, separated from the ocean by migrating sand dunes. This type of formation produces a lake with a characteristic dendritic (branching) shape, in contrast with the long and narrow interdune lakes of the Clatsop Plains such as Coffenbury, Smith and Sunset. However, Cullaby Lake is not nearly as dendritic as many other coastal lakes, Tahkenitch and Siltcoos, for example. The margin of the upland behind the Clatsop Plains describes a gentle, regular curve which marks a coastal bluff developed during an earlier period of high sea level. The site of Cullaby Lake is a broad indentation in this bluff. Thus, it now lies in a shallow depression bordered on the west by relict sand dunes and on the east by low hills of the Coast Range.</p>
<p>The two-mile long lake is fed by several small streams; the largest is Cullaby Creek, draining an extensive swampy area at the south end which includes cranberry bogs. Outflow is north through a ditch into Skipanon Creek, entering the Columbia River about six miles to the north. Originally the lake drained through Neacoxie Creek which flowed northward before turning south into the Necanicum River estuary, but shifting sand dunes and road construction interfered with the flow of the creek and altered the drainage to its present coarse. Water level in the lake now fluctuates from a low of about 7.5 feet above mean sea level in the fall to about 9.5 feet in the early spring. The level can, within limits, be regulated by a weir across the entrance to the ditch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As noted, a fairly extensive cranberry culture has developed on the south shore of the lake. Otherwise, the surrounding landscape is mostly covered by a spruce-hemlock forest. Private timber companies own most of the land on forested slopes to the east. As seen in the accompanying air photo, much of this land has been logged off in the last few years and regrowth has barely begun. The north and west shoreline of the lake is zoned residential and there are several private homes at the north end which are connected to sewer lines.</p>
<p>The main focus of recreational activity at Cullaby Lake is the warm-water fishery. Pan fishing is excellent from spring through late fall; crappies, bluegill, perch, catfish, and largemouth bass are all taken. In fact, a Portland bass-fishing club holds an annual tournament here. Fishing for catfish is said to be particularly good at the south end of the lake. Cutthroat and rainbow trout are also found in the lake, but generally not fished with much success. Clatsop County maintains a large park, Cullaby Lake Park, on the northwest shore; it includes a boat ramp and dock, restrooms, playground, picnic tables and a sandy beach. There are no overnight facilities at the lake.</p>
<p>From a water quality standpoint, the distinguishing characteristic of Cullaby Lake is its high concentration of dissolved organic matter (McHugh 1972). Lake water is deeply stained with a dark brown color and the transparency is consequently reduced. Large marshy areas around the shoreline, particularly at the south end, contribute partially decayed vegetation and cause the high concentration of dissolved aquatic humus. In this case, the Secchi disk depth cannot be used to indicate trophic state because it is not a measure of phytoplankton crop. Other indicators, such as total phosphorus, chlorophyl, and the abundance of blue-green algae indicate a highly eutrophic state for Cullaby Lake. It should be noted that this is largely a natural condition for this lake, and adverse cultural influences are minimal.</p>
<p>Associated with the high nutrient content, Cullaby Lake has two serious problems that restrict use and appreciation: summer algal blooms and dense beds of macrophytes. On occasion in summer, the blue-green algae grow to such a large population that the shoreline accumulates piles of ""green paint"" (predominant blue-green genera are <em>Aphanizomenon, Anabaena, Anacystis</em>). This deters participation in water contact sports, which are normally very popular, and creates unpleasant odors. The phytoplankton are mostly diatoms during the spring and fall (<em>Melosira granulata</em>). During winter, cooler water temperatures supportpredominantly cryptomonads (Cryptomonas). The phytoplankton sample collected on 4/17/82 showed two species of algae to be more abundant than Cryptomonas; however both of these algae are quite small, and the</p>
<p>biomass was dominated by Cryptomonas. Other phytoplankton samples not reported here show that this successional pattern occurs year after year. Nearby houses are connected to a sewage treatment plant, thus should not be contributing to nutrient levels. The nutrients supporting the algal blooms are derived from the adjacent marshes, a natural source which would be difficult to control by artificial means. The shallowness also allows nutrients to be resuspended from the mud sediments. Future control of these algal blooms seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Likewise, the macrophytes are not easily controlled. They are found along nearly the entire perimeter of the lake and create the greatest problem in the narrow channel at the north end which connects the main lake with the permanent residences. At present, each season's crop of macrophytes are kept from totally choking the channel by the action of boat motor propellors cutting off the tops. Future control may be feasible in this relatively small channel by the use of fiber glass screens, herbicides, or some other technique that may be investigated. The macrophytes are probably light limited in the central areas of the lake although the maximum depth is only 12 feet.</p>
<p>Cullaby Lake is slightly acidic most of the year (pH less than 7.0, usually 6.5). The concentrations of major ions and the conductivity are above average for coastal lakes. Both alkalinity and conductivity are lower in winter and spring, but increase in the summer and fall. This seasonal pattern may well be due to the more rapid rate of flushing in the wet winter season as compared with the summer.</p>

"Lava Lake","218","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Lava Lake is one of many scenic mountain lakes on the east slope of the Central Oregon Cascades accessible from the Cascade Lakes Highway. It takes its name from the surrounding lava flows, which are prominent along the east shoreline. Lava flows from Bachelor Butte probably altered drainage patterns in the area and formed the lake with a lava dam. Very little surface drainage has developed in this volcanic terrain, and there are no permanent surface streams entering the lake. Wire Meadow, a marshland of about 35 acres with many seeps and small springs, is the source of most of the surface water draining into Lava Lake. Ordinarily there is no surface outlet, but during periods of high water there is some flow south through an open channel into Little Lava Lake, from which the Deschutes River flows. Thus, Lava Lake may be considered as the source of the Deschutes River. However, this claim must be considered tenuous in a region of permeable volcanic materials where groundwater flow is prevalent. Water level tends to fluctuate an average of three to four feet per year with high water occurring in late summer.</p>
<p>Lava Lake is relatively old, as evidenced by the extensive vegetation along the shallow littoral areas. A variety of macrophytes grow on the southwest and northwest ends of the lake and the adjacent meadows are possibly remnants of what was once a larger lake area. Another indication of aging is the layer of muck on the lake bottom, which is reported by skin divers to be four to five feet deep in some places. Several subsurface springs enter the lake in the northeast corner. In a 1962 survey by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, springs at 20 feet below the water surface of Lava Lake registered 60 degrees Fahrenheit (16 degrees Celsius); deeper springs were 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7 degrees Celsius). Concentrations of large trout were observed more frequently in the spring areas, moreso than in other locations in the lake.</p>
<p>There is a good Forest Service campground at Lava Lake; there is also a private resort on the south shore. Angling for brook trout and rainbow trout is excellent. Brook trout outnumber the rainbow trout, which have been stocked only in recent years; but the rainbow trout are generally larger. Fly fishing is particularly good because of the extensive shoal areas.</p>
<p>The Lava Lake basin has a somewhat rectangular shape, with the long axis oriented north-south. The sides of the basin are relatively steep, especially along the north and east of the lake where the lava dam that formed the lake is located. The mineral content of the water in Lava Lake is typical of Cascade lakes for the most part, although sulfate appears to be somewhat above average. The concentration of chlorophyl is low, and water transparency is average. The concentration of phosphorus observed on 8/21/81 is surprisingly high (0.53 ppm). The concentration of phosphorus in Little Lava Lake was also high, suggesting that the springs feeding these lakes may be rich in natural phosphorus. At present, Lava lake is oligotrophic, with some tendency to mesotrophic as indicated by the chlorophyl and phosphorus content.</p>

"Lake Harriette","206","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Lake Harriette is a small, deep lake situated high in the southern Oregon Cascades. The colorful and rugged topography in this region is the result of an unusual geologic history. The deep blue cirque lake sits at the heart of a mountain mass that millions of years ago was a large composite volcano. Like Mt. Mazama to the north, the summit of this ancient cone collapsed on itself, creating a large caldera. However, instead of leaving a distinct crater similar to its famous neighbor, subsequent ice periods brought the deep scouring of glacial erosion, gouging the caldera rim into a ring of remnant peaks. Small lake basins and broad valleys now lie scattered in and around the old mountain, creating a jumbled and unexpected terrain. Mountain hemlock, Shasta fir, and lodgepole pine stand around Lake Harriette, but the slopes of this over-steepened, bowl-shaped amphitheatre basin are too unstable or rocky to support a dense growth of trees.</p>
<p>The lake is triangular in shape, and consists of a single basin with the deepest point near the middle. Surface temperatures remain cool throughout the summer, although the lake develops a pronounced thermal stratification with a thermocline near 10 feet (3.3 meters) deep. Water quality in the lake is excellent; the concentrations of major ions, conductivity and alkalinity are among the lowest measured in any of the lakes in Oregon. Phosphorus and chlorophyl concentrations are extremely low and water transparency is among the highest of Oregon lakes.</p>
<p>By all measures, Lake Harriette is ultraoligotrophic, a trophic state enhanced by several factors: the drainage basin is composed of rock types that are fairly resistant to weathering, thus limiting the supply of nutrients; vegetation growth is limited for the reasons noted above, further restricting nutrient input; and finally, the short growing season at this high altitude sets a limit on productivity. This combination restricts the natural reproduction of fish. However, it also enhances the transparency and aesthetic properties of the water in this jewel of a mountain lake.</p>

"Agency Lake","147","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et. al 1985) Agency Lake, so named because of the Klamath Indian Agency nearby, is actually the north arm of Upper Klamath Lake and together they constitute a single hydrologic entity. Agency Lake receives surface runoff from a relatively small area (about 244 square miles), only a fraction of the total 3,800 square miles that drain into Upper Klamath Lake. The water surface elevation of the entire water body is controlled at the outlet from Upper Klamath Lake so that it varies from about 4136 feet to 4143 feet above sea level. Fluctuations are due to withdrawals for irrigation and downstream power production. Wood River is the primary inflow into Agency Lake, with an average annual runoff of 171,800 acre feet as measured at Fort Klamath. It is a spring-fed river and thus maintains a fairly constant flow throughout the year.</p>
<p>The majority of the Agency Lake drainage basin is in private ownership; portions to the east of Wood River are in the Winema National Forest and the upper reaches in Crater Lake National Park. The Klamath Lake National Wildlife Refuge adjoins the lake on the southwest and the entire lake environs are a good waterfowl habitat. About 31 percent of the drainage basin is agricultural land irrigated with water from Wood River, Fourmile Creek and Sevenmile Creek.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Agency Lake is extremely shallow for its size and is frequently exposed to strong winds. The water is constantly well mixed and does not develop any persistent temperature stratification. Frequent mixing also leads to suspension of bottom sediments. The concentrations of ions in the lake are slightly above average for freshwater lakes in the state and the pH of the water is frequently above 9 during the summer when heavy algal blooms develop. Primary productivity in the lake is high and it is a good producer of rainbow and brown trout which pass through to Wood River and Sevenmile Creek. This shallow lake is hypereutrophic because of the high concentrations of nutrients from Wood River, and from nutrient rich sediments. The hypereutrophic condition is a result of natural processes and no significant modification appears possible at any realistic cost. The frequent blooms of blue-green algae, primarily Aphanizomenon, are stimulated by the heavy loading of phosphorus to the lake. Although the concentrations of nitrate and ammonia are not high, Aphanizomenon is a nitrogen fixer (that is, it changes atmospheric nitrogen to nitrate and ammonia) and by this process supplies this essential nutrient to the lake. Aphanizomenon appears much earlier in the season and reaches higher densities than in Upper Klamath Lake. Agency Lake thus has a higher trophic state, indeed one of the highest in Oregon.</p>

"Sturgeon Lake","122","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Sturgeon Lake is the most dominant of the maze of floodplain lakes located just downstream from the confluence of the Columbia and Willamette Rivers. It is located within Sauvie Island and is a large, shallow, mud-bottomed lake. It is a creation and a reflection of the Columbia River, with the lake surface rising and falling with the river stage; inflow and outflow is through the Gilbert River. The very shallow but large lake occupies the middle of Sauvie Island, one of the largest river islands on the continent. The southern end of this island has long been rich in farmland, and numerous dikes protect the flat area from seasonal flooding. Much of the northern end, including most of the land surrounding Sturgeon Lake, was acquired in 1947 by the Oregon State Game Commission (now the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife) as a refuge to provide suitable habitat for wintering waterfowl. Large populations of birds have long used this area for feeding and nesting. Approximately one-half of the waterfowl wintering in the Willamette Valley stay on Sauvie Island. Lewis and Clark, passing by the island in 1802, noted ""Our choice of camp was unfortunate as with us were immense numbers of geese, swans, and ducks which during the night serenaded us."" More than 220 species of birds are known to be present here sometime during the year; the most obvious include great blue herons, whistling swans, Canada geese, and sandhill cranes.</p>
<p>Most of the shoreline is open for viewing, hiking, and canoeing. Hunting is seasonally allowed around some Tarts of the lake. Fishermen can find all types of warm-water fish in the murky waters, but catfish and crappies seem to provide the most successful catches. Boat launching can be difficult in the low water season, and water level fluctuations have occasionally stranded boats on the extensive mud flats. The lake was named in the very early days, probably from the mistaken belief that it provided spawning grounds for the very large sturgeon found in the Columbia and Willamette Rivers. Legend holds that these fish came ashore from the lake to pick the fruit from the nearby apple trees. Incidentally, the largest sturgeon on record, over 12 feet long and weighing 1285 pounds, was caught just a few miles away near Vancouver.</p>
<p>The ecological characteristics of Sturgeon Lake are largely determined by its extremely shallow depth and the tidal influence from the Columbia and Willamette Rivers. Suspended sediments in the inflowing water settle out and are deposited on the lake bottom. Winds and wave action maintain a high concentration of sediment in the water column, and as a result transparency is very low. The annual range is 0.3 to 4 feet (0.1 to 1.2 meters), but the average is at the lower end (Klingeman et al 1982). Other water quality parameters, such as high phosphorus and chlorophyl concentrations, indicate that this lake is eutrophic. Major ion concentrations and conductivity are similar to the Columbia and Willamette Rivers.</p>
<p>Sturgeon Lake has several problems in addition to the main problem of siltation: it experiences algal blooms (<em>Aphanizomenon </em>and <em>Anabaena</em>); it is plagued with high levels of bacteria; and the lake perimeter is being invaded by willows. Submerged macrophytes are not abundant, largely due to the limited water transparency, unstable sediments, fluctuating water levels, and the activities of carp that abound in this lake. The sedimentation problem was investigated by Klingeman et al (1982) in a study sponsored by the West Multnomah County Soil and Water Conservation District in 1980. In addition to reporting extensive data on the lake and surrounding environments, they studied in detail the causes, rates, and effects of sedimentation in the lake. Modifications made in the area of Sturgeon Lake over the past four decades have accelerated the sediment deposition, which is currently estimated to be about one inch per year. These modifications include diking, dredge spoil disposal, blocking of creeks, and reservoir flood control operations. Subsequently, the lake was becoming shallower and smaller, willows were invading the exposed shoreline and, of particular concern, habitat sought by the waterfowl was slowly being destroyed. Klingeman et al provided many options for managing silt deposition in their report, options which include dredging, flushing, damming, lake isolation, and others. The long-term recommendation for rehabilitation was to reopen Dairy Creek, a tributary of the lake, and thereby reestablish natural flushing from the Columbia River. Although the lake would not become appreciably deeper, it would be expected that further sedimentation would be prevented and water quality would improve.</p>

"Walton Lake","288","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Walton Lake is a small reservoir in the Ochoco Mountains of Central Oregon. It was formed in the 1940s by construction of a 28-foot high, earthfill dam in a marsh near the headwaters of Camp Creek. The reservoir is a contribution to the people of Oregon from the Isaak Walton League of Prineville in honor of their well-known patron. Walton Lake is operated to provide quality public recreation, and the League has been successful in achieving this goal. It attracts anglers in a part of the state where few natural lakes exist. Catches of rainbow trout are good, and the fish are stocked regularly by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. Swimming is also a popular recreational activity. Motorboats are prohibited. Two Forest Service campgrounds are maintained at the lake for use by visitors.</p>
<p>Water chemistry in Walton Lake is typical of reservoirs in the Blue Mountains. Major ions exist in moderate concentrations; calcium and magnesium in particular are above average for Oregon lakes. As expected, conductivity, pH, and alkalinity are also above average. Macrophytes develop in the shallow areas and emerge above the surface along the shore. The concentration of phosphorus is above average, while water transparency and chlorophyl concentrations are average. Based on these last two characteristics, Walton Lake is classified as mesotrophic, whereas the macrophytic growth and phosphorus concentration indicate a tendency toward a higher trophic status.</p>

"Wolf Creek Reservoir","293","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Wolf Creek Reservoir is a fairly new irrigation impoundment in northeastern Oregon located on Wolf Creek, a tributary of the Powder River. It serves to regulate flows into the larger Thief Valley Reservoir downstream on the Powder River. The reservoir lies in a triangular shaped basin oriented east-west with the dam located at the eastern end. It is mostly surrounded by grassland but there are small patches of forest at the upper end around the inflowing stream. There are also several prominent rocky outcrops at the western end of the reservoir. The upper portion of the drainage basin lies within the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. Fish are routinely planted and the reservoir is a popular fishing spot. There is an excellent boat ramp which allows boat launching even when the reservoir is drawn down in late summer. Picnic tables with wind and sun screens are available above the reservoir.</p>
<p>The concentrations of minerals in the reservoir are low in spite of the relatively arid climate. The concentration of phosphorus is moderate and supports the growth of phytoplankton, including occasional blooms of blue-green algae. There is very little macrophyte growth. The pH of the water is somewhat above neutrality because of phytoplankton growth. The reservoir is drawn down extensively in late summer by irrigation withdrawals, exposing muddy banks around the reservoir. Water transparency is limited, partially because of the phytoplankton but also because of some erosion from the exposed shoreline during drawdown. The reservoir is classified at the lower end of eutrophy.</p>

"Little Lava Lake","222","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Little Lava Lake lies immediately southeast of its larger namesake, Lava Lake, in the Central Oregon Cascades. Lava flows from nearby Bachelor Butte probably changed drainage patterns in the area and the Lava Lakes, as well as others nearby, were formed by the damming effect of these flows. The lake takes its name from this terrain and from the flows clearly visible along the shoreline. Two volcanic peaks, Broken Top and South Sister, are prominent on the skyline to the North. Forest cover around Little Lava Lake is composed mainly of lodgepole pine, with little understory vegetation. Both Lava Lake and Little Lava Lake are relatively ""old"" lakes as evidenced by the marshy areas around the shoreline, where a rich variety of emergent macrophytes are seen. The largest wetland area is on the east shore and is shown as part of the lake on the bathymetric map. Water in Little Lava Lake is supplied by subsurface springs and, on occasion, there is surface flow from Lava Lake through an open channel. Outflow is into the Deschutes River, and the lake is generally considered the source of this famous Oregon stream. During the severe drought of 1977 no outflow occurred from the lake and springs fed the Deschutes River just downstream from its usual source.</p>
<p>Little Lava Lake does not receive as much recreational use as Lava Lake; still it is quite popular, although the fishing is not considered to be particularly good. Rainbow trout are stocked yearly and brook trout are self-sustaining. Rainbow trout make up most of the catch. There is a Forest Service campground near the outlet of the lake.</p>
<p>The lake basin has a triangular shape, with a maximum depth of only 18 feet. The bottom is covered in most places with thick sediments which support the growth of rushes and other emergent macrophytes at the northern and southern ends of the lake. The chemistry of the water in the lake is very similar to that of Lava Lake, and, except for a sulfate concentration which is a little above average, similar to many other lakes in the Cascades. The concentration of chlorophyl is low, and water transparency is about average. Little Lava Lake is mesotrophic, although the relatively high phosphorus supply causes the lake to approach higher trophic conditions.</p>

"Vernonia Millpond","286","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Vernonia Millpond, as the name implies, is a man-made lake originally used for log storage. It is located in the northern part of the Coast Range adjacent to the city limits of Vernonia and was at one time the site of the Oregon-American Forest Products mill. Several decayed pilings are still present in the pond and remnants of the old sawmill stand on shore. There is no natural surface inflow or outflow to or from the pond; the storage level is maintained by pumping water in from the nearby Nehalem River. Thus, the drainage basin would have to be considered the entire Nehalem drainage above this point, a rugged region of forested slopes. The pond and surrounding land are within the urban growth boundary of Vernonia, and in the city's Comprehensive Plan this area is designated as a Light Industrial Zone. In spite of the fact that there are no facilities around the lake to attract the public, fishing is quite popular with local residents. Rainbow trout, catfish and bluegill are reportedly the favorites.</p>
<p>The pond is quite shallow throughout and is encircled by emergent macrophytes. The bathymetric map included here was constructed by the U. S. Geological Survey, with soundings made at a time when the water level was below normal and a great amount of brush was exposed. The water is very low in dissolved ions. Transparency is poor and the lake is apparently partially depleted of oxygen on occasion, events associated with eutrophic lakes. The chlorophyl and total phosphorus concentrations, however, are more indicative of mesotrophic conditions. Vernonia Millpond is completely encircled by a gravel road so that the entire shoreline is open and accessible to the public. As a resource the pond is important to the local citizenry, and the city of Vernonia encourages its maintenance as a recreation site and wildlife sanctuary.</p>

"Deer Lake","181","<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, FreeSans, sans-serif;""><span style=""line-height: 18px;"">(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985).&nbsp;</span></span>Deer Lake is one of the many small, shallow lakes in the Cultus Lake drainage basin, a region of moderate relief high on the east slope of the Cascade Mountains. A dense lodgepole pine forest blankets the landscape, which is interspersed with lovely mountains and many small, shallow lakes. Many of these lakes adjoin marshy areas and are gradually being reduced in size as vegetation encroaches. Deer Lake, however, is forested to the water's edge and there are no macrophytes in the lake, despite the fact that over half the lake is less than 10 feet deep. A large percentage of the shallow areas consist of clean pumice material, giving the appearance of a sandy bottom, and it is relatively free of organic material. The lake is triangular in shape with the deepest point near the center. Fishing is good at times and the lake is stocked yearly with brook trout. There are also some fair—sized rainbow trout. There are no improved campsites at Deer Lake, but camping is fairly common near the shore at the end of the unimproved road from Little Cultus Lake. Water in Deer Lake is characteristic of lakes in the Cascades, with low concentrations of ions, low alkalinity, and low conductivity. The pH of the water is slightly less than average, and the lake has a very low buffer capacity. Phosphorus concentration is about average while the chlorophyl concentration is quite low. Water transparency is very high, and the bottom of the lake is visible even in the deepest part. By all indicators, Deer Lake is oligotrophic.</p>","17070301000892","","149198971","01140853","Deer Lake","1"

"Valsetz Lake","285","<p>
<p><em>Valsetz Lake is a historical log pond that was drained in 1988.</em> &nbsp;</p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Valsetz Lake (also commonly known as Valsetz Pond) was formed by the damming of the South Fork of the Siletz River to create a log pond for timber storage. The community of Valsetz, one of the few remaining ""company towns"" in Oregon, is situated near the northeast shore. Timber interests have controlled this remote, rugged area of the Coast Range since early in the century. Boise-Cascade now owns much of the forested drainage basin, the town of Valsetz, Valsetz Lake and its entire shoreline as well as the mill standing on shore. The name Valsetz was composed from the Valley and Siletz Railroad which has its terminus here -- Valley from the terrain and Siletz from the name of the nearby river.</p>
<p>Valsetz has received some dubious fame as the wettest town in Oregon (189 inches of precipitation in 1957). The combination of heavy winter rains and impermeable soils leads to heavy runoff to the lake in early spring. Second-growth Douglas fir dominates the terrain throughout the drainage basin and deeply weathered, steep slopes encourage much mass movement of soils. Public use of this privately owned lake has made it a popular fishing site for local citizens. Brown trout, cutthroat trout and largemouth bass are taken and there is a fish ladder at the spillway to encourage the migrating species. However, according to a 1979 report by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, a stunted population of largemouth bass is depressing the potential for trout and salmon production.</p>
<p>The shallow lake is littered with sunken bark, logs and parts of old buildings that have decayed and fallen in -- all a legacy of the original use of the impoundment. Log rafts of various ages, some with vegetation sprouting on them, are moored around the shore. The lake develops a pronounced thermal stratification, especially in the summer, and oxygen is sometimes depleted, probably because of the organic debris present from the decay of sunken logs. Shallow embankments around the shoreline, particularly at the southeast end, support dense stands of surface and submerged macrophytes. Based upon the combination of Secchi disk depth, chlorophyl and total phosphorus Valsetz Lake is classified as mesotrophic.</p>
<p>It should be noted here that Valsetz Lake has been observed to have an interesting biologic assemblage. In particular, species of algae typical of extremely clean habitats are found in the spring. Apparently, the heavy runoff at this time of year dilutes the water in the lake significantly. Later in the year, algal forms representative of enriched conditions are found. In general, the lake has some characteristics common to a log pond, and some common to a Desmid lake (slightly acid, low in calcium and magnesium ions, and rich in humic or organic matter); yet it is abundant in macrophytes and iron bacteria while the number and diversity of plankton are low (McHugh 1972).</p>

"Torrey Lake","279","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Torrey Lake is one of many backcountry lakes scattered over the terrain north of Waldo Lake in the Central Oregon Cascades. It can be reached by a one-mile trail that starts two and one-half miles north of North Waldo Lake Campground, on the Taylor Burn Road. The region is a wide volcanic plateau that has been glaciated. Consequently, a dominant feature of the area is the abundance of ephemeral ponds and small lakes, many without surface drainage. Vegetation cover is a typical mountain hemlock forest with little understory growth. The whole area is within the Waldo Lake Recreation Area, a ten square mile tract administered by the Willamette National Forest. With this designation Torrey Lake and others in this quiet region will continue undeveloped and should retain their primitive nature. Anglers have found Torrey Lake to be a good producer of rainbow and eastern brook trout. Torrey Lake has no apparent surface inflow, and outflow appears limited to high water channels to nearby Whig and Wahanna Lakes. The relief of the drainage basin is fairly low; Taylor Butte, a prominent landmark on the plateau, rises directly to the north.</p>
<p>Torrey Lake is very shallow, with a maximum depth of only 13 feet, and over 90 percent of the lake is shallower than 6 feet. There are two forested islands in the lake, the larger near the south shore. Water quality is very good. The concentrations of major ions, alkalinity and conductivity are among the lowest in Oregon lakes. The concentrations of phosphorus and chlorphyl are also very low. Water tranparency is high and the bottom of the lake is easily visible. This pristine lake is classified as oligotrophic; however, because of its shallow depth it could be easily disturbed by any increase in nutrients.</p>

"Wickiup Reservoir","142","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Wickiup Reservoir, when full, is the largest body of water in the Deschutes National Forest and is the second largest reservoir in Oregon; only Owyhee Lake (reservoir) is larger in surface area. However, Wickiup Reservoir is a relatively shallow impoundment (mean depth 20 feet) and several in the state have greater storage capacity. The history of this impoundment on the Deschutes River began in the 1920s when it became apparent that the flow of water in the river and its tributaries was insufficient to supply all the demands placed on it. Irrigated agriculture had become an important segment of the economy of Central Oregon, and with maximum runoff occurring in spring and early summer supplies were inadequate in late summer when agricultural demand is greatest. Construction of small water storage facilities along the river began in the 1920s and in 1921 the Bureau of Reclamation began to make plans for two large reservoirs, Wickiup and Crane Prairie, on the upper Deschutes. Waters above Bend had already been withdrawn from further appropriation in anticipation of this Deschutes Project by the State Engineer. For Wickiup Reservoir 200,000 acre-feet were appropriated for storage; for Crane Prairie Reservoir 50,000 acre-feet. The water was identified for the irrigation of agricultural land downstream. Preliminary work on Wickiup Dan was started in the summer of 1939 by Civilian Conservation Corps workers. Work slowed during World War II and the 100-foot high, earth-fill dam was not completed until 1949.</p>
<p>The Deschutes Project thus consists of Wickiup Dam and Reservoir, Crane Prairie Dam and Reservoir, Haystack Dam and Reservoir, North Unit Main Canal and lateral system, and the Crooked River Pumping Plant. The project furnishes a full supply of irrigation water for about 50,000 acres of land within the North Unit Irrigation District, and a supplemental supply for more than 47,000 acres in the Central Oregon Irrigation District and Crook County Improvement District No. 1. These are lands downstream on the Deschutes River near Madras. Storage for the North Unit Irrigation District is provided specifically by Wickiup Reservoir, and releases from the reservoir are diverted from the river at North Canal Dam near Bend. Water is carried to the project lands by the North Unit Main Canal and distributed through a system of laterals. Although the waters released from the reservoir are primarily for irrigation, in cooperation with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife sufficient water is released at all times to maintain a productive fishery in the Deschutes River downstream.</p>
<p>Wickiup Reservoir receives the drainage from the Deschutes River Basin above the point of impoundment; this is a forested region entirely within the Deschutes National Forest. Primary inflow is from the Deschutes River, water which has been stored and released from Crane Prairie Reservoir five miles upstream. Several other small surface streams contribute inflow, including Davis Creek which drains four miles underground from Davis Lake beneath a large lava flow before surfacing. Davis Creek is fed by a flow from several large springs which discharge an average of 250 cfs in total. When the reservoir is full, water backs up to the lava flow, submerging the springs.</p>
<p>The site of Wickiup Reservoir has a long record of human habitation. Long before local residents considered the Wickiup area for a reservoir, Indians had used the site as a campground for their fall hunting and fishing expeditions (Hatton 1980). There is also archaelogical evidence of Indians living in the area more than 10,000 years ago. In later years, ranchers who grazed their livestock in the basin applied the name ""Wikiup"" to the area because of the huts left behind by the Indians. Originally, the site was spelled Wikiup, but since 1939 the official spelling has been Wickiup. Today, Wickiup Reservoir is perhaps the busiest in terms of recreational use among the many lakes accessible from the Cascade Lakes Highway. It is used extensively by fishermen. A large number of scrap fish (chubs) have occupied the reservoir for years, yet a productive sport fishery has been maintained. A combination of large brown trout, rainbow trout, and coho salmon seem to thrive and hold the chubs in check. Many kokanee have also been caught in recent years. The reservoir is noted for its brown trout fishing, not in terms of numbers but in size; they are taken mostly by trolling. Large rainbow trout are also taken; one productive method is wading the shorelines and flycasting to surface activity. Boats can be rented at South Twin Lake, across the road from Wickiup's North Campground. Davis Creek and the Deschutes arms have several good Forest Service campgrounds and are popular fishing areas for both&nbsp;boaters and wading shore fishermen. There are several sites for launching boats on the lake, and there is also much angling from thedam. After mid-summer, the water level is drawn down to supply downstream users and the surface area is reduced considerably. At that time extensive mudflats are exposed, making access to the water more difficult. The deepest part of the reservoir is along the old channel of the Deschutes river, and contains sufficient water for boating and fishing even at maximum drawdown.</p>
<p>The conductivity (reflecting major ion concentrations) in Wickiup Reservoir is higher than in most other Cascade lakes (51 umhos/cm), although nearby South Twin Lake has an even higher conductivity (116 umhs/cm) due to springs entering the lake. Major ions in Wickiup&nbsp;may be derived from similar sources. The phosphorus concentration is also higher (0.033 mg/1) than in Cascade lakes generally, and much of it is probably derived from Crane Prairie Reservoir which has very high concentrations of phosphorus (.108 mg/1) and empties into Wickiup. Additional phosphorus is recycled from the bottom sediments in Wickiup Reservoir because it is so shallow. The phosphorus supports a moderate phytoplankton population. The sample reported in this survey shows a very high density, but the size of <em>Chromulina</em> is quite small and therefore the total biomass is similar to other lakes in the region. Interestingly, <em>Chromulina</em> was also dominant in Davis Lake, which flows into Wickiup through underground channels. Other algal species observed in the nannoplankton sample include many periphytic diatoms, or diatoms that grow attached to substrates and most often occur in flowing water. A net phytoplankton sample consisted almost entirely of<em> Gloeotrichia echinulata</em>, a colonial blue-green alga that is clearly visible to lake users. Other algae include <em>Asterionella formosa</em> and <em>Fragilaria crotonensis</em>. In spite of the moderate amount of phytoplankton, water transparency is very good (26 feet; 8 meters).</p>
<p>Wickiup Reservoir is classified as mesotrophic. Although the phosphorus concentration is quite high, phytoplankton densities (hence, chlorophyl concentrations) remain low to moderate. The reservoir was stratified at 26 feet (8 meters) on 7/17/82 and there was no dissolved oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion. There are some macrophytes present in some of the shallow bays in this dendritic reservoir, but they are not over-abundant.</p>

"Wahtum Lake","287","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Wahtum Lake is a relatively remote, scenic lake located about seven miles north of the better known Lost Lake on the north slope of Mt. Hood. Wahtum is thought to be the Waucoma Indian name for the lake, but its meaning is not clear. The name was bestowed by H. D. Langille in 1901 while mapping the region for the U. S. Geological Survey. Because of the once abundant supply of berries in the area, Wahtum Lake was a popular gathering point for Indians during the annual harvest. In more recent times a Boy Scout Camp operated on the northwest end of the lake, but burned down in the 1940s.</p>
<p>Wahtum Lake is an excellent example of a cirque lake, its basin carved out by glacial erosion. Typical of this mode of formation is the amphitheatre shape of the basin and the steep surrounding walls. The lake itself is very deep, with a maximum depth of 184 feet. Slopes in the small drainage basin are covered with a dense, coniferous forest, while huckleberry and blueberry bushes form much of the understory vegetation near the shore. Several small, unnamed streams flow into the lake. The East Fork of Eagle Creek is the outlet stream, but flow is minimal much of the year.</p>
<p>Wahtum Lake is a popular recreation site, reached by a short, downhill trail from the Forest Service road. Fishing is good at times, the catch being small rainbow and brook trout. Native brown trout once prospered in the lake, but during the 1960s rainbow trout were introduced with the intent of providing stock for a downstream hatchery. Unfortunately, the fish became diseased and the program was discontinued. Rainbow trout are a hardier species than brown trout and still exist in the lake. However, Wahtum Lake is not a particularly good fishing site because of the depth and the history of diseased fish. The best fishing is in the shallow shoal areas. There are a number of primitive campsites around the lake maintained by the Forest Service.</p>
<p>Wahtum Lake is deep enough to develop a distinct thermal stratification. The concentrations of major ions are fairly low, similar to other nearby Cascade lakes (Lost Lake and Bull Run Lake), but the water is not as dilute as in other high Cascade lakes farther south. The concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyl are low and the water is very transparent. All these characteristics are indicators of an oligotrophic lake.</p>

"Bull Run Reservoir Number Two","161","<p>
<p>(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). Bull Run Reservoir No. 2, formed in 1961 with the completion of an earth and rockfill dam, is the newest of the two reservoirs on the Bull Run River. It lies at the western end of the Bull Run Reserve, a 214 square mile region that includes the Bull Run Watershed which provides a dependable supply of high quality water to the City of Portland and adjacent areas. The Bull Run Forest Reserve was created in 1892 by presidential proclamation, giving substance to the concept that undisturbed watersheds are critically important to the maintenance of a high quality water supply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Reserve remained largely in primitive condition until the mid-1950s, when tree harvesting and access roads were permitted in order to alleviate concerns about uncontrolled fires sweeping through the virgin Douglas fir and western hemlock forests. A hydroelectric power generation facility has been added to the reservoir by Portland General Electric, but the city of Portland continues to have exclusive rights to the watershed. Water is withdrawn just below the dam, is chlorinated, and delivered to conduits for transport to the City.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Water in Bull Run Reservoir #2 is of the same high quality as that in the upstream impoundment. Concentrations of major ions, alkalinity, and conductivity are all low and water transparency is very high. It is an oligotrophic water body, although an algal bloom was observed once shortly after construction. Maximum depth at the reservoir is over 100 feet and a distinct thermal stratification develops in summer. An occasional problem with turbidity in the water does occur, as discussed in the previous report on Bull Run Reservoir No. 1.&nbsp;</p>

"Smith Lake (262)","262","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Smith Lake is a long, narrow and shallow lake located in the northern Clatsop Plains about one mile from the Pacific Ocean. The name of the lake is derived from Solomon Smith, one of the earliest American settlers in western Oregon. Smith was a schoolteacher and one of the organizers of the provisional government in 1843. The vicinity of the lake has been continuously occupied since that time. Smith Lake is of the same geomorphic origin as nearby Coffenbury Lake, a typical coastal interdune lake situated between relict sand dunes trending north and south. The water level varies seasonally from about 15 feet above mean sea level in the fall to about 17.5 feet in the early spring. Inflow is by seepage and direct precipitation; outflow by seepage and evaporation. On occasion there is also outflow through a culvert at the north end to Cemetery Lake. However, depending on relative lake levels, the flow through the culvert may instead be into Smith Lake. The shoreline is now entirely in private ownership and homes are established on at least half of it. Access for the public is not provided, although two roads that cross the lake can be used to reach the water. Water rights to the City of Astoria exist for supplemental irrigation of 24 acres.</p>
<p>Drainage from the bog areas around the lake causes the water to be stained with dissolved organic matter. The high level of nearby residential development is probably another significant source of nutrients in the water. In recent years cattails, water lilies, iris and other macrophytes have steadily encroached upon the open water of Smith Lake, especially at the shallower southern end, even to the point that fishing and boating are nearly excluded. Water surface vegetation is very clearly illustrated in the accompanying air photo. The concentrations of major ions are slightly above average for coastal lakes in Oregon. Oxygen is sometimes depleted in the bottom of the lake, but in general the water is well-mixed and shows little tendency for stratification. The boggy nature of the lake and surrounding area is reflected by the microflora, which has been noted to consist largely of desmids. Desmids prefer water of low calcium and magnesium concentrations, neutral to acid pH, and low alkalinity. All of these conditions are found in Smith Lake.</p>
<p>Smith Lake has been altered physically several times over the years and shortened from the south end by a succession of road fills. In 1969 a narrow channel was dredged along a section near the west shore. At a depth of about two or three feet a layer of clean, white sand was encountered. The material removed was entirely peaty material composed of decomposed plant residues, huge rhizomes of water lilies and live roots and stems of various macrophytes. McHugh (1979) suggests that lakes of this type, sand dune lakes that originally had clean sand bottoms, provide an opportunity for reclamation by the dredging of bottom deposits. If the accumulated organic material can be removed to reveal a nutrient-low substrate, a lower trophic level could presumably be attained. As it is, Smith Lake is classified as eutrophic.</p>

"Fish Lake (195)","195","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Fish Lake, a large and deep back-country lake in the upper drainage basin of the South Umpqua River, is located within the Umpqua Divide Scenic Area. The lake was formed in recent geological times when a large portion of the face of Grasshopper Mountain moved as a landslide two miles north into Fish Creek Lake Canyon, forming a natural dam and impounding the waters behind it. The first two miles of the outlet, Fish Lake Creek, can be seen cascading down the ""face"" of this natural dam. Some of the trees that were covered by the impounded waters are still present in the southwest portion of the lake, evidence of the recent formation. Two smaller lakes (Buckeye Lake, 15 acres, and Cliff Lake, 7 acres) were formed by the landslide at the same time.</p>
<p>Trails to Fish Lake receive fairly heavy use in the early part of trout season, but for the most part the region remains relatively uncrowded and isolated. Hikers may still experience the ""grand forest of fir embosing three beautiful lakes"" and the ""massive peaks of frowning rocks"" as first described by O. C. Brown in 1899. Brown was with a group of local horsepackers who were seeking a new route to Crater Lake. Presumably, this party named the lake and it is one of ten in the state so named.</p>
<p>Water quality is excellent, although major ion concentrations, alkalinity, and conductivity are somewhat above average for Cascade mountain lakes. The bottom of Fish Lake basin slopes uniformly to a single maximum at the center with a depth of over 120 feet. Shallow water areas on the perimeter support extensive growths of submerged and emergent macrophytes, especially along the eastern shore where High Rock Creek enters. The water is quite clear with a transparency of 25.3 feet (7.7 meters), and concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyl are low; these are indicators of oligotrophic conditions. However, the lake develops a distinct thermal stratification, with very cold water below 40 feet, and there is some tendency for oxygen depletion in the deeper water. The reputation that the lake has for good fishing, the dissolved oxygen data and the growth of submerged macrophytes are all indicators of significant biological productivity in Fish Lake.</p>

"East Lake","72","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;East Lake is one of two lakes occupying Newberry Crater, a volcanic caldera nearly five miles in diameter. It is slightly smaller and is about 40 feet higher in elevation than its neighbor to the west, Paulina Lake. The caldera, estimated to be 20,000 to 25,000 years old, is the result of volcanism similar to that which created Crater Lake (Williams 1953). Newberry Volcano is a shield-type volcano, a type which forms over ""hot spots"" where lava is rising from deep within the earth. It has a base of about 20 miles in diameter and dominates the landscape of the high lava plateau southeast of Bend. More than 150 cinder cones occur on its flanks. The original conical peak collapsed after radial drainage had removed support for the higher slopes. Explosive activity has occurred at intervals throughout recent geologic time; the topmost pumice layer between the lakes was laid down about 2050 years ago and there are lava flows on the slopes of Newberry Mountain that are probably no more than 1000 years old.</p>
<p>After formation of the caldera, snow and ice associated with the most recent period of glaciation accumulated to depths of ,several hundred feet; flowing ice may have helped to scour the outlet from Paulina Lake that cuts through the flank of the crater (Russell 1Q05). Ash and lapilli from late phases of volcanic activity formed deposits&nbsp;that partly sealed the bed of the lakes. It is apparent that the caldera was once occupied by one lake, but subsequent volcanic action built up a series of cinder cones running north and south across the middle of the caldera, dividing it in two and forming two lakes. Were it not for the breaching of the crater by Paulina Creek the water level in Newberry Crater would be much higher and the caldera would more resemble that of Crater Lake. However, the end result is equally as spectacular. The crater rim rises steeply above the lakes to a high point of 7984 feet at Paulina Peak. Slopes, where not exposed by bare rock and lava flows, are covered by a forest cover typical of mountain terrain in regions of moderate precipitation; that is, a lodgepole pine forest with ponderosa pine scattered throughout. There are also some hemlocks, and alders. The physiographic setting is similar to that of Crater Lake except that surface area of the lake occupies only 8.4 percent of the caldera.</p>
<p>Phillips and Van Denburgh (1968) described the hydrologic regime of East Lake. The maximum depth of the lake is about 180 feet and much of the northern half is deeper than 100 feet. There is no visible inflow to the lake; seasonal runoff from snowmelt provides water, but the major source is a number of small, mineralized hot springs near and below the lake surface on the southeast shore. Other springs probably exist at greater depths around the lake. The elevation of the water surface has experienced a range in this century from about 6366 feet to 6382 feet above sea level, although it rarely varies more than two feet in a single year. Several factors account for this minimal fluctuation: the lack of surface streams, a close balance between annual precipitation and evaporation, and an apparently low rate of seepage loss. There is no surface outlet from East Lake; water is lost by seepage and since the water in the lake is fresh, the rate out must be at least as large as the rate of flow into the lake from mineralized springs. It is likely that a large part of the topographic basin for East Lake does not contribute water to the lake, but drains out to the flanks of the volcano. There is thought to be a substantial contribution from East Lake to Paulina Lake which is about 40 feet lower, a fairly large gradient in an area of recent lava flows.</p>
<p>Trout fishing is the primary attraction for visitors to East Lake. However, at the time of the lake's discovery in the early 1800s only warm water, non-game fish were present, and those only in the area of the hot springs. Late in the century, a Central Oregon sportsman packed in rainbow trout and released them in the lake. Sometime around the turn of the century, eastern brook trout and German Browns were also planted. The latter did so well that East Lake was for years the state's main source of German brown trout eggs, which were used to stock other waters in Oregon. Over the years, the population of Browns has been reduced and very few are now caught, although a lake record German Brown (22 pounds, 8 ounces) was caught in May 1982. Rainbow and brook trout now make up the majority of fish taken by anglers. There are three distinct under-water ridges or reefs in the lake, above which fishing for trout seems to be particularly successful. There is one resort providing a range of facilities and services, the East Lake Resort, which is located near the submerged hot springs. There are also three large Forest Service campgrounds on the shoreline.</p>
<p>The water chemistry of East and Paulina Lakes is exceptional in many respects, and is strongly influenced by their presence in a volcanic crater where there is a significant flow of water from hot springs. These springs contribute high quantities of major ions and algal nutrients which in turn stimulate biological productivity. The concentrations of major ions in East Lake are exceeded only by a few Oregon lakes in areas of internal drainage. Conductivity (310 umhos/cm) and alkalinity (103 ppm) are also unusually high. The concentration of sulfate (as much as 80 ppm) is exceptionally high, and probably results from the inflow of water from the hot springs located near the eastern edge of the lake. Paulina lake, which has higher concentrations of most major ions than does East Lake, has much less sulfate than East Lake. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown. East Lake develops a thermal stratification during the summer, and sometimes freezes over in the winter. The summer thermal stratification is unusual in some respects: the deep water in the lake is slightly warmer (41 degrees Fahrenheit, 5 degrees Celcius) than might be expected, and the conductivity decreases with depth (conductivity 201 near the bottom and 250 at the surface on 9/13/81), suggesting a complicated mixing process involving both heat and salinity in the lake.</p>
<p>The concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyl were moderate in samples collected during this study, suggesting mesotrophic conditions. However, water transparency is good and indicates a lower trophic state. The species of phytoplankton present (<em>Dinobryon</em>, <em>Oocystis</em>, and <em>Sphaerocystis</em>) are associated with oligotrophic to mesotrophic conditions, in agreement with other indicators. It should be noted that <em>Fragilaria crotonensis</em>, a eutrophic diatom, was present in both phytoplankton samples, but at low densities. Overall, East Lake is mesotrophic, but at the lower end.</p>

"Warm Springs Reservoir","289","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Warm Springs Reservoir is a large irrigation impoundment in the semi—arid region of southeastern Oregon. It was formed by the construction of Warm springs Dam, a 106—foot high concrete arch dam, on the Middle Fork of the Malheur River just above its junction with the mainstem Malheur River. The dam was built by the Warm Springs Irrigation District and storage began in 1919. In 1926, one—half of the storage in the reservoir was purchased for use on the Bureau of Reclamation's Vale Project, which furnishes irrigation water to about 35,000 acres of land near the town of Vale. The project also includes Agency Valley Dam and Beulah Reservoir, Bully Creek Dam and Reservoir, Harper Diversion Dam, The Vale Main Canal, and a distribution and drainage system.</p>
<p>The reservoir lies against steep hills on the eastern side of a broad valley which, prior to reservoir construction, was irrigated by ditches from the Malheur River. It receives drainage from an area of about 1100 square miles, a mountainous region of folded and faulted volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Most of the semi—arid landscape is used for grazing, while the upper portion of the drainage basin is in the Malheur National Forest. Lower reaches are mostly lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management. There are no recreational facilities at the reservoir, and road access is difficult. Therefore, its potential as a recreation site is unrealized. Primary use is for fishing, and it is managed for both rainbow trout and for warm—water game fish. It is also reported to be one of the few havens for channel catfish in the state. Migrating waterfowl also use the reservoir.</p>
<p>Warm Springs Reservoir is about 4500 acres in surface area when full, but because it is used for irrigation it generally is very low by late summer, with surface area reduced dramatically. Like most other reservoirs in southeast Oregon its water quality is influenced by inflowing water that contains high concentrations of major ions (conductivity 160 umho/cm), phosphorus (.069 mgP/1), and sediment. This reservoir, however, has a lower trophic state than others in the region due to its greater depth (average depth is 68 feet). In 1982 the reservoir was stratified as early as June 22, with the thermocline between 13 to 20 feet (4 to 6 meters). Even so, the reservoir is eutrophic. The abundant phytoplankton, in conjunction with high concentrations of suspended sediment, reduce the transparency to only 3 feet (1 meter). There are a few macrophytes found in shallow bays, but the greatly fluctuating water level and limited water transparency prevent extensive development of the macrophytes.</p>

"Dexter Reservoir","185","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Dexter Lake is a relatively small, shallow reservoir which functions as a reregulating basin for Lookout Point Lake immediately upstream. As such it is designed to contain, temporarily, surges of water released intermittently from Lookout Point Lake during hydroelectric power generation, thereby avoiding widely fluctuating flows downstream. Accordingly, the volume of water stored in Dexter Lake varies considerably throughout the year. It is one of 13 multi-purpose water projects built by the Corps of Engineers in the Willamette Valley. Dexter and Lookout Point Lakes were completed in 1954 with the construction of dams on the Middle Fork of the Willamette River and, in combination, have since prevented an estimated $200&nbsp;million in damages from downstream flooding. A small amount of hydroelectric power is also generated from a powerhouse at Dexter Dam with one generating unit. In spite of fluctuations in surface water level, Dexter Lake is a very popular recreation site, used very heavily by water-skiers and sailboaters. Lane County parks on both the north and south shores provide full day-use facilities. Angling is also a popular activity and the lake is open for fishing all year, although there have been problems with infestation by rough fish in recent years.</p>
<p>The drainage basin for Dexter Lake is, of course, the same as for Lookout Point Lake; it is a forested area stretching to the crest of the Cascade Mountains. The lake itself lies in the transition zone between the mountains and the Willamette Valley, an area of gentle topography that consists of alluvial fill and old river terraces, surrounded by remnant buttes of basalt and diorite. The western hemlock and Douglas fir forests that dominate the drainage basin show great variety around the lake where there has been significant alteration of vegetation. About three-quarters of the drainage basin is managed by the Willamette National Forest. There are significant amounts of private holdings upstream around the town of Oakridge and adjacent to the lower half of Lookout Point Lake and around Dexter Lake.</p>
<p>The thermal properties of this reservoir are somewhat unusual because it is fed by cool water discharged from the bottom of Lookout Point Lake. This cool water tends to sink in Dexter Lake and maintains thermal stratification which would otherwise not develop in such a shallow reservoir. The major ion chemistry is typical of western Cascade reservoirs. There is extensive growth of rooted macrophytes and occasional algal blooms, including diatoms and cyanophytes. Chlorophyl and phosphorous concentrations and water transparency suggest that the lake is mesotrophic. However, because the lake shows some tendency to develop algal blooms and oxygen is sometimes depleted, it is classified as mesotrophic, a condition encouraged by the shallow depth.</p>

"Elk Lake","74","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Elk Lake is a beautiful mountain lake located in the volcanic landscape of the upper Deschutes River Basin. It lies southeast of the Three Sisters Range at an elevation of 4884 feet above sea level, and is accessible from the Cascade Lakes Highway. The lake received its name because of the large number of elk that used to be seen nearby in the summer. Elk Lake, like many other high Cascade Lakes was formed as a result of volcanic activity, when a lava flow impounded the flow of several small streams. Surface flow to the lake is intermittent and occurs during the snowmelt season; subsurface seepage through the permeable volcanic bedrock accounts for most of the water in the lake. There is no surface outlet. It is not a particularly deep lake; average depth is less than 18 feet, and the maximum depth is about 62 feet. The shoreline generally falls off gradually and is rocky. Bottom material is rock and sand.</p>
<p>Elk Lake has long been one of the most popular lakes in this lovely recreation area on the east slope of the Cascades. The Three Sisters form a spectacular backdrop to the north and symmetrical Bachelor Butte looms over the lake to the east. The lake is used heavily for recreation, with sailing and swimming activities heading the list. Fishermen also frequent the lake, as much for its scenic beauty as for the angling success. For many years Elk Lake was famous for its fishing, and was also long known as a source for fish eggs. For example, in January 1919 some 350,000 eastern brook trout eggs were gathered there, brought to Bend by sled, then dispatched by auto to the Bonneville Hatchery (Hatton 1980). In recent years there has also been good fishing; eastern brook trout make up a large share of the catch, with some rainbow trout and stocked kokanee or land—locked salmon. A 10 mile per hour speed limit for motorboats is in effect on the lake. Extensive recreational facilities have been provided at or near the lake by the Deschutes National Forest. There are four campgrounds, three boat launch sites, and picnic grounds located around the lake. An excellent private resort with cabins is located on the west side, and there are about three dozen summer homes around the perimeter of the lake. Most of these are on the west shore with a few on the east. Swimming beaches exist at the resort and at each of the campgrounds. Trails to high lake areas such as the Horse Lake and Mink Lake basins start here, so it is a good base area for hikers. The lake freezes over most winters, and opens in late April; however, in most years the roads are blocked by snow until late May.</p>
<p>Elk Lake is elongate in shape with the major axis of the basin oriented north and south. The deepest part of the lake is located at the southern end. Most of it is shallower than 20 feet deep, and as a consequence it becomes relatively warm during the summer. Water temperature during the summer commonly exceeds 68 degrees F. (20 degrees C.), and there is usually very little temperature stratification in the lake. Although 68 degrees Fahrenheit is cool for swimming, it is warmer than most of the deeper lakes in this recreation area, and Elk Lake is a popular swimming lake.</p>
<p>The lake was surveyed for nutrient enrichment and bacterial contamination in 1969 by the Department of Environmental Quality. The results of the survey indicated generally good water quality conditions, although there was some evidence of enrichment and bacteria derived from inadequately designed or maintained sewage facilities. The shallow average depth of the lake makes it vulnerable to nutrient enrichment.</p>
<p>Although the indices of trophic state clearly establish Elk Lake as being oligotrophic, there are some indications that cultural activities may be increasing the trophic status. At times, higher than normal phosphorus concentrations are observed, and stimulated phytoplankton growth increases the pH of the surface water. Also, the phytoplankton species present indicate a trophic state higher than oligotrophic. <em>Fragilaria crotonensis</em> was common in samples collected in 1981 and 1982; this diatom is usually observed in mesotrophic to eutrophic lakes and rarely in oligotrophic lakes. <em>Asterionella formosa</em> also occurs most commonly in mesotrophic lakes, but is not uncommon in either oligotrophic or eutrophic lakes.</p>

"Anthony Lake","150","<p>
<p>(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Anthony Lake, only 22 acres in size, is the largest of several lakes in the Anthony Lakes Recreation Area in the Elkhorn Mountains of eastern Oregon. This is a beautiful alpine region of rugged peaks and high mountain meadows, streams and lakes, and is a favorite attraction for outdoor enthusiasts in the summer. The Elkhorn Mountains, like the other high mountain areas of Oregon, were covered by glaciers during The Pleistocene Epoch and modern landforms owe their distinctive characteristics to the erosional and depositional action of the ice. Glaciers flowed slowly down the mountain valleys, and moraines formed at their termini. Later, as the ice retreated, the moraines served as dams to impound the flow of streams and form beautiful mountain lakes. Anthony Lake was formed in this manner, supplied by the headwaters of Anthony Creek, a tributary of the North Powder River. The small rugged drainage basin consists of granitic rock types covered with thin soils. A lush coniferous forest surrounds the lake, becoming less dense at higher elevations where rock outcrops predominate. Angell Peak at 8646 feet elevation is the high point in the drainage basin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fishing in Anthony Lake is good for stocked rainbow trout, and native eastern brook trout are also caught. Several good Forest Service campgrounds surround the lake and there is also a private resort with accomomodations, supplies, and boats available. A public boat ramp is on the south shore; no motor boats are allowed. The small lake is quite shallow with a mean depth of about 10 feet and a maximum depth of about 32 feet. Most of the shoreline is rocky, but there are shallow deltas where the streams from Hoffer Lakes and Lily Pad Lake enter. Emergent macrophytes cover most of these delta areas. Water quality in the lake is excellent. The concentrations of major ions, phytoplankton populations, and natural biological productivity are all low; and the water is very transparent. Anthony Lake is distinctly oligotrophic.&nbsp;</p>

"Tenmile Lake","130","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Tenmile Lake is the largest in a series of lake basins that drain the west side of the Coast Range south of the Umpqua River. It is the farthest south in a chain that includes Clear Lake, Eel Lake, North Tenmile Lake and several smaller water bodies. The lake was originally known as Johnson Lake, but the U. S. Board of Geographic Names has officially named it Tenmile Lake; the name South Tenmile Lake is incorrect but is in common usage. Tenmile and North Tenmile Lakes were undoubtedly named for Tenmile Creek which connects them to the ocean. In turn, the creek was so named because it was supposed to be about 10 miles south of Winchester Bay, the first pioneer settlement on this part of the coast.</p>
<p>The entire chain of lakes owes its existence to the same series of geological events as described by Cooper (1958). Ancestral Tenmile Creek was the mainstem of a stream network that drained this entire region, Eel Creek a tributary entering from the north, and Clear Creek a tributary of Eel Creek. During a time of coastal submergence which accompanied post-glacial warming, the whole system underwent a period of readjustment. The main valley and the lower courses of its tributary valleys were inundated. A bar of sand dunes formed across the river mouth and the ponded valley thus became a large lake with branches extending up the tributaries. As submergence continued the depth of the lake increased and the arms were extended farther upstream. At the same time, dunes along the shore north of Tenmile Creek were advancing inland and eventually entered broadside into the valley of Clear Creek, impounding its headwaters and forming what is now Clear Lake. As drainage from Clear Lake flowed into the Eel Creek valley a delta began to form which developed into a sand flat blocking off the upper portion of the valley and giving rise to Eel Lake. The overflow from Eel Lake then carried sand farther downstream and resumed delta formation in the lake occupying the submerged valley of Tenmile Creek. The delta extended itself across the lake to the south shore and farther upstream and downstream. Upstream the delta made contact with the promontory separating the large, submerged north and south arms of Tenmile Creek, thus segregating the present North Tenmile Lake and (South) Tenmile Lake, and producing the extensive sand flat upon which the village of Lakeside now stands. Since that time, movement of sand has ceased and a forest cover has developed so that there have been no further substantial modifications of the drainage pattern.</p>
<p>The drainage basin of Tenmile Lake is thus quite large and includes the basin of North Tenmile Lake within it. Other major tributaries entering the various arms include Shutter Creek, Adams Creek, Johnson Creek and Benson Creek. In contrast to Eel and Clear Lakes, the Tenmile Lakes are quite shallow and have filled in with rich organic matter which washes in from the drainage basin; narrow marshes border the lakes in several areas. The bottom material is sand, muck and peat. In some places around Tenmile Lake the surface topography is very steep and there is frequent slumping of overlying sedimentary material into the water, thereby gradually reducing lake depth. The upland area of the drainage basin is primarily covered by forest and is almost totally in private ownership, as is the shoreline of the lake.</p>
<p>The ecological characteristics of the Tenmile Lakes are dominated by their very shallow depth and the effects of introduced species of rooted macrophytes, particularly the Brazilian water weed (Elodea). Major ion concentrations are below average for coastal lakes; but phosphorus and chlorophyl concentrations were above average, and nitrate values were extremely high when sampled for this survey. Water transparency is below average for coastal lakes. These are all indicators of an eutrophic lake. Algal blooms are frequently observed in the water, and there is a noticeable oxygen depletion of the bottom water even though the lake is shallow. The phytoplankton surveys reported here showed quite high algal densities in spring and late fall, when cooler water temperatures normally reduce algal densities. Summer algae would be even more dense. A bloom of <em>Aphanizomenon</em>, a blue-green alga typical of highly eutrophic lakes, was reported by in August, 1956 (Phinney and McLachlan 1956). Phytoplankton data for 11/22/82 show <em>Gomphosphaeria</em>, also a blue-green eutrophic alga, to be dominant in terms of biomass. McHugh (1972) reported dominance of <em>Melosira</em> during winter months, which again is typical of eutrophic lakes. The summer, fall, and winter phytoplankton contain indicators of eutrophic conditions; however the spring sample is more typical of a lower trophic state as indicated by the biomass dominance of Dinobryon. Dinobryon is usually regarded as occurring most frequently in low-phospate, or oligotrophic, lakes, but this may be an exception. Undoubtedly some of the nutrient input into the lake is due to the heavy recreational use and the large number of homes around the shoreline. Also, the shallow nature of the lake allows nutrients to be resupplied readily from bottom sediments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenmile Lake has long been popular with recreationists from the local area as well as with large numbers of users from the interior valleys. In fact, Tenmile Lake receives more use by boaters (over 40,000 boater use days per year) than any other lake in Oregon (Frenkel 1975). Like the north lake, Tenmile has good rainbow fishing but it is the success with bass and panfish that attracts most anglers. Largemouth bass activity has been so good that limits are often the rule. Bluegill is the most prolific species in the lake.</p>
<p>In spite of the excellent fishing now found in Tenmile Lake, the history of the fishery is an unfortunate one (Grenfell 1969, Schwartz 1977). Earlier this century large populations of cutthroat trout, silver salmon and steelhead passed through the Tenmile Lakes system to spawn in the tributary streams. The rich, productive lakes provided an ideal habitat for fish growth. The size of fish taken by anglers was impressive and the reputation of the Tenmile Lakes as producers of trophy fish was well established. In an attempt to create more variety and to develop a warm water fishery, yellow perch and brown bullhead were introduced, probably in the 1920s. These new species prospered, but at the expense of the salmon and trout. In time the quality of the salmon and trout fishery declined drastically as the increased numbers of warm water fish decreased the food supply. Studies of the problem were begun by the State Game Commission about 1938 and in 1953 an intensive study program was started with the goal of eliminating undesirable species and rebuilding the salmon and trout runs. These runs had also been adversely affected over the years by the deterioration of spawning grounds. Logging operations made some tributaries unsuitable for spawning salmon, while on others siltation reduced productivity. Much loss has also resulted from re-channeling of streams by landowners to obtain better drainage and more farming areas, usually in the flatter areas around the mouths of tributaries that make good pasture.</p>

"Dorena Lake","187","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Dorena Lake is a multi-purpose reservoir located in the gently rolling hill country of the southern Willamette Valley. It was formed by impounding the waters of the Row River about seven miles upstream of its confluence with the Coast Fork of the Willamette River. One of 13 Corps of Engineers water resource projects in the Willamette Valley, it was one of the first to be operated, having been constructed in 1949. Construction actually began in 1941, but was delayed by World War II. The primary function of Dorena Lake, as with nearby Cottage Grove Lake, is flood control and it has been estimated by the Corps that more than $87,000,000 in flood damages have been prevented over the years because of their presence. High water levels are maintained in the lake from May to mid July, after which a lowering begins in order to meet downstream requirements. By mid-September the lake is usually down about 40 feet below full pool. During the winter months it is lowered to the minimum pool to provide storage for flood water. Given the relatively flat topography of the area, there is a considerable decrease in lake area and shoreline length during the draw-down.</p>
<p>Dorena Lake is located only about 20 miles from the center of Eugene and is thus extremely popular for recreation. Boaters and swimmers use the lake extensively and angling is considered to be very good. Large numbers of rainbow trout are planted annually; other species include bluegill, largemouth bass, cutthroat trout and catfish. Lane County operates two parks with boat ramps at the lake and camping is available on the southwest shore.</p>
<p>The shoreline of the lake is under management of the Corps of Engineers. Private land encompasses most of the lower half of the drainage basin, while the Umpqua National Forest administers most of the upper half. Although Dorena Lake lies at the lower edge of the western hemlock vegetation zone, very little of this climax forest species is found near the lake or in the lower portion of its drainage basin. Extensive logging and other land use modifications have created a varied pattern of vegetation throughout the area. Some of the lower part of the drainage basin is used for agricultural production, with some private timberland.</p>
<p>Dorena Lake is nearly 100 feet deep at full pool and develops a distinct thermal stratification during summer. There is some oxygen depletion in the water near the bottom, and surface pH can be as high as 8; these are conditions that normally suggest moderately eutrophic conditions. However, major ion concentrations are about average for Willamette Valley reservoirs and the concentrations of chlorphyl and phosphorus are low; these factors suggest a classification of mesotrophic. Fish production in the lake is somewhat limited because of the fluctuation of water level. Elevated levels of mercury have been detected in the tissue of fish taken from Dorena Lake in recent years, and this has been attributed to the occurrence of natural mercury deposits in the drainage basin. Analysis of fish tissue by the Department of Environmental Quality in 1983 showed these levels to still be below the U.S. Food and Drug Administration action levels.</p>

"Mann Lake","232","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Mann Lake, named for a local rancher, is a shallow playa lake located in the northern portion of the Alvord Valley. This part of the valley is fairly narrow; therefore the alluvial material carried from the enclosing escarpments has formed barriers for a number of small playa lakes. Mann Lake is the largest of these, while Tudor Lake and Juniper Lake to the north are other examples. All are relicts of a larger lake that covered the area during the Pleistocene Epoch when precipitation was greater and evaporation less. Mann Lake is fed by small, intermittent streams that emanate from the east slope of Steens Mountain. There is also intermittent inflow on the east side of the lake, but the drainage basin boundary cannot be identified. Being a lake basin of interior drainage, water is lost by evaporation. The surrounding landscape is a semi-arid rangeland for the most part, although the valley floor south of the lake and most of the shoreline consists of marsh area. While the valley floor is mostly private land, the slopes to the east and west are under administration of the Bureau of Land Management. The lake contains a population of Lahontan cutthroat trout and is managed by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife as a source for the eggs of these fish.</p>
<p>The lake basin is a simple oval shape with a maximum depth of about 14 feet, too shallow to develop any permanent thermal stratification. Lake surface area and depth decrease significantly during dry years. Extensive shallow areas support dense growths of submerged and emergent macrophytes, and unusually large aggregations of <em>Cladophora</em> (a planktonic alga) have been observed in the lake. The concentrations of major ions are exceptionally high (sodium and potassium are particularly high), due to high rates of evaporation in this arid region. The concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyl are also exceptionally high, identifying Mann Lake as hypereutrophic; it is one of the most eutrophic lakes in the state. Surface water pH is well above average and there is significant depletion of oxygen near the bottom, both caused by the intense growth of plankton and macrophytes. The lake is naturally eutrophic, but nutrient inflow is enhanced by wastes from cattle which frequently graze in the vicinity.</p>

<p style=""line-height: 1.2em;""><span style=""line-height: 19px;"">(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Clear Lake, a large and deep natural lake on the Oregon Coast new the mouth of the Umpqua River, serves as a municipal water supply for the city of Reedsport five miles to the north. For this reason it is closed to public access and use. However, the lake is well known because it lies adjacent to the heavily travelled Coast Highway. Clear Lake, Eel Lake and the Tenmile Lakes are all a part of an old stream system partly blocked by the encroachment of coastal sand dunes. The whole system now discharges to the Pacific Ocean through Tenmile Creek in northwestern Coos County. Clear Lake itself occupies the valley o: the ancestral headwaters of Clear Creek and was impounded behind sand dunes as they moved inland across the Clear Creek valley. Thus, the lake was gradually shifted upstream farther into the headwater region. The water level is now at an elevation of 229 feet above sea level, unusually high for a dune dammed lake on the Oregon coast. Clear Lake receives inflow from several small, intermittent streams. Outflow is south through Edna Lake, into Clear Creek, and on into Eel Lake. The U. S. Geological Survey reports that seepage occurs into unconsolidated sediments along the south and southwest margins of the lake (Renewal et al 1980).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.2em;""><span style=""line-height: 19px;"">The drainage basin of Clear Lake was logged during the early 1940; and is now covered by brush and a second-growth forest that frames the shoreline. The steep topography continues into the lake basin which is steep-sided and very deep. The deepest portion of this dendritic shaped lake is located at the confluence of the northern and middle arms; there is a second deep basin in the southern arm. Because of the depth, then is little opportunity for the growth of macrophytes. However macrophytes do develop in the shallow ends of the arms.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.2em;""><span style=""line-height: 19px;"">A pronounced temperature stratification develops in the summer although the temperature difference between top and bottom is not great The bottom water (hypolimnion) sometimes becomes partially depleted of oxygen after stratification has occurred, a feature attributed to the inflow of organic material from marshy areas in the drainage basin. Water throughout the lake has a low alkalinity. Phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations suggest mesotrophic to oligotrophic conditions. Similarly, the species of planktonic algae (e.g. <em>Cyclotella stelligera</em> and <em>Melosira sp</em>.) are found in both mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes. Given the extremely high water transparency (Secchi disk depth = 23.0 feet; 7.0 meters), Clear Lake is classified as oligotrophic.</span></p>

"Sunset Lake","272","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Sunset Lake (also known commonly as Neacoxie Lake) is one of several lakes on the Clatsop Plains on the northern Oregon coast and is similar in geomorphic origin to nearby Coffenbury and Smith Lakes. It is an interdune lake, unusually long (three miles) and narrow, and is situated between relict sand dunes that trend north and south. Seasonal variation in water level occurs in response to fluctuations in the regional water table, from about 20 feet above mean sea level in the fall to about 22 feet in the early spring. There is no surface inflow to the lake, water coming from direct precipitation and from seepage; surface outflow is through Neacoxie Creek to the south.</p>
<p>Farms and pastureland surround much of Sunset Lake. On the west shore is a concentration of summer homes and resorts; to the northeast is a public park and the Astoria Country Club which has a small water right for golf course irrigation. Access to the lake is convenient at several points and there are good facilities for boat launching. Recreational use is quite heavy at times, angling being the principal activity. Rainbow trout are stocked and taken quite successfully. Cutthroat trout, yellow perch, crappie and catfish are also present.</p>
<p>Sunset Lake is slightly deeper than other lakes in the area and will, on occasion, develop a thermal stratification in spite of exposure to the strong prevailing winds of the Oregon coast. The hypolimnion is sometimes partially depleted of oxygen. Conductivity is above average and the alkalinity is among the highest of the coastal lakes observed in this survey. The reason for the high alkalinity is not known. Lake water is slightly stained with organic matter and transparency is limited (Secchi disk depth = 3.0 feet; 0.9 meters). Most of the buildings around the lake use septic tanks for sewage disposal, which means that there may be some enrichment of algal nutrients from this source as the soils in the area are sandy and very permeable.</p>
<p>Coliform counts on Sunset Lake are often higher than those of most Oregon recreational lakes, but the reason is not evident. It may in part be due to drainage from farmland or from fecal matter produced by waterfowl. BOO levels are consistently low, indicating that little organic matter is entering the lake (McHugh 1972). The species of algae vary considerably at different ends of the lake (see McHugh 1972 for a detailed listing). Those in the center of the lake include some diatoms that are more typical of flowing waters (e.g. <em>Gomphonema, Cymbella, Epithemia,</em> and especially <em>Rhoicosphenia</em>). Many dense beds of macrophytes are found around the periphery of the lake. As with nearby Smith Lake, Sunset Lake might lend itself to an improvement of water quality by dredging down to the clean sand layer which underlies the accumulatedorganic matter on the bottom. The Secchi disk depth, high concentrations of algal nutrients and the chlorophyl indicate a eutrophic state for Sunset Lake.</p>

"Collard Lake","173","<div>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Collard Lake is a small, sheltered, natural lake on the central Oregon coast and was named for Roy Collard who took up a homestead near the lake many years ago. Collard and North Collard Lakes are uppermost in a chain of Lane County lakes that also includes Clear and Munsel Lakes immediately to the south. The Collard Lake basin is a deep, steep-walled depression bordered by sand dunes to the west which in many places rise to 50 feet or more above the water level. These dunes are moving towards the northeast and slowly encroaching on the water. There is no discernible surface inflow into the lake; water enters by seepage and by direct precipitation. Surface outflow to Clear Lake is through Collard Creek at the south end under a dense cover of brush and willows. The water level varies seasonally by two to three feet in response to seasonal fluctuations in the regional water table. The geologic origin of the lake and a description of surface drainage of the area is given in the Clear Lake report earlier in this volume.</div>
<div>Along the east shore are the relatively steep slopes of the foothills of the Coast Range. This terrain is owned by private timber interests and much of it has been logged off. The shoreline of both Collard and North Collard Lakes is entirely in private ownership, with development on the north and northeast sides where there are several residences. In the last few years this development has been particularly intensive. The only access to the lake is over a private dirt road, a former logging road which is in poor condition. Small boats can be launched at the end of the road if permission is obtained from local property owners. No motorboats are permitted. Very little recreational use is made of the lake from anyone other than local residents, but the potential for further recreational development exists. Cutthroat trout and largemouth bass are reported to inhabit the waters, but fishing pressure is light.</div>
<div>The water in Collard Lake has low conductivity and alkalinity, but it does show some enrichment with sodium and chloride. Thermal stratification develops in the summer and there is, on occasion, a pronounced depletion of oxygen in the deeper water, the hypolimnion. The concentrations of total phosphorus and chlorophyl and the water transparency suggest that the lake is mesotrophic to oligotrophic, whereas the oxygen depletion and the species of phytoplankton (<em>Melosira granulata</em>, <em>Scenedesmus bijuga</em> and <em>Chroococcus turgidus</em>) suggest a more eutrophic condition, although <em>Chroococcus turgidus</em> is also found in oligotrophic waters. A classification of mesotrophic is thus suggested by the combination of indicators. Retention time of water in Collard Lake is above average for coastal lakes, because of the relatively small drainage basin. This long retention time probably contributes to the observed oxygen depletion. About 25 percent of the lake is shallower than 10 feet, and there is some growth of water lilies and other macrophytes in the narrow constriction between the two basins. Any degradation of water quality in Collard Lake due to future development on the shoreline or for any other reason is of particular concern because the lake discharges into Clear Lake, which is used as a municipal water supply.</div>","17100206000578","","90016661","01139985","Collard Lake","3"
"Glacier Lake","202","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Glacier Lake, as the name implies, is a spectacularly beautiful glacial lake located high in the Eagle Cap Wilderness of northeastern Oregon. It is a classic example of a cirque lake, its basin scoured out of the mountain side by a glacier during the Pleistocene Epoch. The mode of origin is obvious in the steep—walled, amphitheater shaped basin and in the deep bowl of the lake. A maximum depth of over 120 feet is attained at the western end, with a second depression near the southern shore of the eastern end. Most of the shallow area is in the northeast part of the lake where there are several islands. The West Fork of the Wallowa River originates in Glacier Lake. Inflow is from the melting of heavy snows that accumulate in the small, rugged drainage basin. Fishing for brook trout in the lake can be excellent in late summer, but most visitors come simply to enjoy the awesome glacial landscape.</p>
<p>The water in the deeper part of the lake (depths greater than 30 feet) is perennially cold, close to 39 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) which is the temperature of maximum density. During late summer, the surface warms somewhat, although the surface temperature seldom exceeds 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius). The considerable depth of the lake (mean depth = 52 feet) and the high altitude (8200 feet) are responsible for the cool temperatures. Water in the lake is very low in chemical constituents. Conductivity, alkalinity, and major ion concentrations are among the lowest of any lakes in Oregon. The most abundant ion, Ca++, may result from the weathering of glacial flour in the drainage basin. Water transparency is excellent and the population of plankton and concentration of chlorophyll are low. Oxygen is saturated at all depths.</p>

"Morgan Lake","240","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Morgan Lake is a small reservoir in the Powder River Valley near the city of LaGrande. It was built early in the century with the construction of a 22-foot high dam on Deal Creek, and it served originally as a private water supply. It has since been acquired for public fishing under a cooperative agreement among the city of LaGrande, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the Isaak Walton League. The lake is stocked regularly with rainbow trout, and the fish grow rapidly in the productive water; most anglers catch their limits. No motorboats are allowed on the lake. There are sanitary and picnic facilities available for visitors, but no campgrounds. However, there are several undeveloped campsites located on the shoreline. The natural drainage basin to Morgan Lake is very small, and the major inflow is water diverted through a canal from Sheep Creek. Outflow is into Deal Creek, with much of it returned immediately back to Sheep Creek. The terrain surrounding the lake is relatively flat and rocky and much of it is covered by a sparse pine forest. It is, for the most part, private land, although the lake itself is owned by the city of LaGrande.</p>
<p>The concentrations of major ions, alkalinity and conductivity in Morgan Lake are above average for lakes in northeastern Oregon. Water transparency is moderate (7.8 feet; 2.4 meters) and the chlorophyl concentrations are low. The concentration of phosphorus is surprisingly high and indicates that the lake should be classified as eutrophic. The environs are managed as a wildlife refuge, and there is a substantial population of ducks and other waterfowl on the lake. There is also some cattle grazing in the drainage basin, and both of these activities contribute to the elevated concentrations of phosphorus. Much of the lake is shallower than 10 feet, thus making nutrients available to the surface water. The lake develops a strong thermal stratification, and by late summer is sometimes anoxic below 15 feet depth. This clinograde oxygen curve is further evidence that the lake should be classified as eutrophic. The reducing conditions in the hypolimnion also accelerate the recycling of phosphorus from bottom sediments, further contributing to the elevated phosphorus in the surface water. Cattails, skunk cabbage, water lilies and other macrophytes develop in shallow areas.</p>

"Bobby Lake","158","<p>
<p>(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). Bobby Lake is located immediately east of the Cascade Mountains divide at an elevation of 5408 feet above sea level. Although it is located in the headwaters of the Deschutes River Basin, the closest access point is from Waldo Lake Road in the Willamette River Basin. The lake lies in a rugged area of volcanic terrain that was also affected by glaciation during the Pleistocene Epoch. Most of the runoff in this region is subsurface through permeable volcanic material. No surface streams enter the lake, and the outlet stream, Moore Creek, is intermittent. Vegetation in the drainage basin is a dense coniferous forest, typical of the High Cascades at this elevation. The lake is accessible only by trail and does not receive very heavy recreational use. However, fishing is consistently good; eastern brook trout are taken occasionally up to 16 inches, and it is a good fly-fishing lake with lots of shallow water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The shape of the lake is irregular and consists of several small interconnected basins of very different morphology. The upper, or western, end has a larger surface area, and contains the deepest basin in the lake, reaching a maximum depth of nearly 60 feet. The eastern end of the lake includes a smaller and somewhat shallower basin, and, near the outlet has an elongate and very shallow bay. The water column develops a distinct thermal stratification with a thermocline at a depth of about 20 to 26 feet (6 to 8 meters). A few submerged macrophytes develop in shallower areas, particularly in the shallow bays. The water in the lake is very low in chemical constituents; the concentrations of ions and the alkalinity and conductivity are less than in most Oregon lakes, but are typical of other high elevation lakes in the Cascades. The concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyl are very low, and water transparency is excellent. Bobby Lake is very oligotrophic, nearly ultraoligotrophic, and has very little biological productivity.</p>

"North Tenmile Lake","243","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;North Tenmile Lake is a large natural lake on the Oregon coast south of the mouth of the Umpqua River. It is part of the well-known ""Tenmile Lakes"" system which includes the larger Tenmile Lake immediately to the south. The lakes are named for Tenmile Creek, which connects them to the ocean. The creek was so named because it was thought to be about ten miles south of the pioneer settlement at Winchester Bay. The geological development of these lakes from an old stream system is described earlier in this volume in the Tenmile Lake report. North Tenmile Lake shows a distinctive dendritic, or branching, pattern characteristic of lakes formed in submerged river valleys. Surface streams enter at several arms of the lake and the outflow is into a navigable channel leading to Tenmile Lake about half a mile away.</p>
<p>Most of the shoreline property around North Tenmile Lake is privately owned and some small water rights exist for domestic use and irrigation by local land owners. Timber companies own most of the land throughout the drainage basin, much of which was logged off in the 1940s. Brush and second-growth timber now cover the hills in this part of the Coast Range. North Tenmile Lake receives heavy recreational use, particularly by fishermen, although not as much as Tenmile Lake. It is primarily trout water while the other is a bass lake. Bluegill are also found in North Tenmile Lake in great numbers. In some years coho salmon run up Tenmile Creek to the lakes and provide good angling.</p>
<p>The Tenmile Lakes are later in their geological stage of development than Clear and Eel Lakes, which were part of the same ancestral stream system. Clear and Eel are deeper with relatively steep shorelines. North Tenmile is a shallow lake with a mean depth of 11 feet and is gradually filling in with nutrient-rich sediment from the drainage basin. Narrow marshes border much of the lake and the bottom is composed of sand, muck and peat. There are dense growths of rooted macrophytes, including the genera <em>Brasenia nuphar</em>, <em>Typha</em>, <em>Potamogeton</em>, <em>Myriophyllum</em>, and particularly <em>Elodea</em> which was introduced in the 1940s. The long history of problems with macrophytes and fish populations in the Tenmile Lakes is discussed in the earlier report.</p>
<p>Water quality in the two lakes is similar although North Tenmile is slightly more eutrophic, a determination based on concentrations of total phosphorus and chlorophyl, transparency, conductivity and nitrates. The sample taken on 5/5/82 showed a high nitrate concentration. Algal blooms have been noted, particularly<em> Volvox aureus</em> and <em>Melosira granulata</em>. Both <em>Volvox</em> and <em>Asterionella formosa</em>, also commonly found, have been associated with taste and odor problems, indicating the highly enriched state of North Tenmile Lake.</p>

"Mowich Lake","241","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Mowich Lake is a beautiful backcountry lake high in the Central Oregon Cascades, the largest lake in that portion of the Mt. Jefferson Wilderness known as the Eight Lakes Basin. It is approached by hikers from either of two directions; the most popular route is via the Duffy Lake Trail, five miles from the Santiam Highway; the other route is via Marion Lake from the north. The word Mowich is a Chinook jargon word meaning deer and it has been applied to a number of geographic features in Oregon, although it is not known who applied the name to this lake. However, it is appropriate; the sampling crew on this project startled several deer near the lake.</p>
<p>Mowich Lake lies in a glaciated basin at an altitude of 5077 feet. Topographic relief in the drainage basin is moderate, except to the southeast where Three Fingered Jack rises 3000 feet above the lake and dominates the landscape. A dense coniferous forest blankets the slopes below timberline and extends to the water's edge. Despite being in a designated wilderness, there are some improvements around the lake such as picnic tables and toilets on the east shore.</p>
<p>Mowich Lake is oval in shape and has a large island at the shallow, northern end and deep water at the southern end. In spite of the shallow water, there is no significant growth of rooted macrophytes. Water in the lake is extremely low in major ion concentrations; alkalinity and conductivity are among the lowest for any lake in Oregon. Phosphorus and chlorophyl concentrations are very low, and the bottom is visible even at the deepest point in the lake (52 feet; 16 meters). Mowich Lake is pristine and ultraoligotrophic with very little biological productivity. The trout fishery is maintained only by regular stocking by the Department of Fish and Wildlife.</p>

"Mercer Lake","102","<p>
<p>(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). Mercer Lake is a mid-sized lake of 359 acres on the central Oregon coast. It was named in the 1880s for a government surveyor, George Mercer, who surveyed the township line that passes through the lake. The former Indian name for the lake was Kow-y-ich, meaning simply ""the place of the lake"". The geologic origin of Mercer Lake can be traced to events associated with sea level fluctuations during and since the Pleistocene ice ages. At one time a stream, fed by several tributaries rising in the coastal mountains, flowed across a marine terrace north of Florence to reach the Pacific Ocean. Submergence of the entire coastal strip due to the post-glacial rise in sea level drowned the lower reach of the stream. Subsequently, sand dunes blocked the mouth, impounding the flow of the stream to form Mercer Lake. A sand barrier of this type develops for two reasons, deposition by the stream itself whose gradient has been reduced by submergence of the mouth, and migrating sand dunes brought about by longshore currents, wave action, and wind action. Several other nearby lakes were formed in much the same manner at about the same time; for example, Sutton Lake and the chain of lakes immediately to the south of Mercer Lake -- Collard, Clear, and Munsel Lakes (Cooper 1958).</p>
<p>Mercer Lake thus occupies a former stream valley and has the characteristic dendritic or branching shape of impoundments, whether natural or artificial, that occur in stream valleys. The shoreline is long and irregular. Average water surface elevation is 32 feet above sea level, while the bottom of the lake is below sea level (maximum depth = 38 feet). The lake basin is steep-sided and has a fairly flat bottom due to the accumulation of sediments. Material from the steep slopes around the shoreline frequently slumps into the water. Deposition of material by inflowing streams has filled in much of the area of the former water-filled valleys of Bailey, Levage and Dahlia Creeks, gradually reducing the size of the lake. The perennial outlet is into Sutton Creek Marsh which drains into Sutton Lake.</p>
<p>The drainage basin is quite small and is covered primarily with a coniferous forest on steep slopes. Much of it is land within the Siuslaw National Forest, although there are many private land holdings within the broader National Forest boundaries. The shoreline is about 95 percent private land on which there is a resort and numerous homes. A county road leads from the Coast Highway to the south side of the lake. The road extends up the east side to a public boat ramp at the end of the northeast arm on Forest Service land. Mercer Lake has never been fished very heavily, but it provides excellent angling for trout from early spring well into the summer. It also contains some good-sized largemouth bass and yellow perch. Angling is difficult from the brushy shoreline and boats are a must.</p>
<p>Mercer Lake is an excellent example of a beautiful coastal lake in which the water quality has deteriorated noticeably in response to cultural activities. Concentrations of major inorganic ions in the water are low and alkalinity is low. Macrophytes are not a serious problem because of the steep shoreline, although Elodea is common in some shallow areas. However, the concentration of chlorophyl is above average for coastal lakes and the water transparency below average. Development in the basin proceeded at a rapid rate in the 1970s, particularly along the shoreline. Sixty percent of the shoreline is now developed and many of the homes are at the water's edge. Much of the shoreline has been made accessible by paved roads. Previously published Secchi-disk values indicate a trend of advancing eutrophication. Kruse (1962) reported values ranging from 11.8 to 12.8 feet (3.6 to 3.9 meters), and later Kavanaugh (1973) measured values ranging from 8.5 to as much as 26.6 feet (2.6 to 8.1 meters). Lane County measured values ranging from 6.6 to 14.8 feet (2 to 4.5 meters) in the summers of 1978 and 1979 (Bryant et al 1979). In the survey reported on in this volume, values were lower: 8.2 feet (2.5 meters) on 7/18/81 and 6.6 feet (2.0 meters) on 11/19/82.</p>
<p>Incipient signs of eutrophication can be seen in the floating and emergent stands of macrophytes in the many small bays along the shore. Cattails, bullrushes, sedges and water lilies grow densely in these shoal areas. Further evidence that development has influenced water quality in the lake can be cited. Bryant et al (1979) found higher nutrient concentrations in the more heavily developed ""arm"" of the lake than in other arms, and they believe that the lake, in general, has become more productive in recent years. There is much land for sale adjacent to Mercer Lake; the future will undoubtedly include increased development and water quality should be monitored to detect perturbations resulting from this development. Bryant et al (1979) recommend: (1) provide water quality analysis every three to five years; (2) develop regulations to prevent erosion; and (3) support citizen group efforts for preservation. It should be noted that these recommendations apply to all of the coastal lakes studied by Bryant etal (Sutton, Collard, Clear, Woahink, and Siltcoos), but especially to Mercer Lake which had the highest concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus.</p>
<p>Data collected in this survey show that nitrate is especially high in Mercer Lake (1.02 ppm in May; 0.23 ppm in November). Values for trophic state indicators were at the high end of mesotrophy (Secchi index 47, chlorophyl index 61, and phosphorus index 53). The lake is stratified for at least part of the year, the hypolimnion being low or lacking in oxygen during the summer and fall months. The thermocline varies from year to year, but generally lies at 23 to 30 feet (7 to 9 meters). Winter overturns and complete circulation have been recorded in December and January. Kavanaugh (1973) determined that nitrate was replenished during fall overturn.</p>
<p>An analysis of available phytoplankton data presents a somewhat inconsistent picture with regards to trophic state. A net phytoplankton sample collected on 8/29/74 was predominantly<em> Tabellaria fenestrata</em>, an alga generally assumed to indicate oligotrophic conditions. The sample collected on 7/18/81 was dominated (by weight) by <em>Anabaena sp. </em>and <em>Fragilaria crotonensis</em>, which are most often associated with eutrophic lakes. <em>Tabellaria fenestrata</em> was not found in any of the samples collected in 1981 and 1982 for this study. Another phytoplankton sample collected on 10/30/72 was dominated by <em>Melosira granulata</em>, an alga&nbsp;also not found in the samples of 1981 and 1982. These changes in phytoplankton support other evidence of advancing eutrophication in Mercer Lake. The nannoplankton samples collected in 1981 and 1982 for this study are composed of mesotrophic to eutrophic species, namely A<em>sterionella formosa, Anabaena sp.</em>, <em>Chroomonas sp</em>., and <em>Fragilaria crotonensis</em>. When water temperatures are cooler in spring and fall, <em>Dinobryon</em> and <em>Cyclotella stelligera</em> appear and indicate a lower trophic state; but they are less abundant than the eutrophic algae.</p>
<p>In summary, Mercer Lake is an excellent example of a coastal lake which has begun to deteriorate in response to cultural influence. In spite of the fact that much of the lake is deeper than 30 feet, as are some oligotrophic coastal lakes, it has a higher than average trophic state for Oregon coastal lakes. The current trophic state for Mercer Lake is mesotrophic, but is approaching the eutrophic classification.&nbsp;</p>

"Bull Run Lake","48","<p>
<p>(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). Bull Run Lake, located on the west slope of the northern Oregon Cascades, is one of the least visited yet most important lakes in Oregon. It lies at the head of the drainage basin of the Bull Run River, and is a vital part of the water supply for about a third of the population of the state, which includes much of the city of Portland and adjacent areas. The Bull Run watershed is located within the Bull Run Reserve, a protected region of 102 square miles. This water source is unique in the United States for the degree of protection afforded it, the directives governing its management, and the degree of public input provided for consideration in management planning. Most of the reserve land is owned and administered by the National Forest Service, while the city of Portland owns 3730 acres of timberland. The city owns and operates the storage reservoirs and water conveyance system within the reserve. (See reports on Bull Run Reservoirs No. 1 and No. 2 in this volume.) The lake was named for the river which flowed through a region where escaped cattle ran wild in early pioneer years. The Klickitat Indian word for the lake was Gohabedikt, meaning Loon Lake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seen by relatively few people, Bull Run Lake is one of the most beautiful water bodies in the Pacific Northwest, and lies in a basin formed by Pleistocene glaciation. It is a deep basin, surrounded on three sides by steep ridges with slopes of 30 to 60 percent. These ridges rise from the lake (-3175 feet above sea level) to a high point of 4654 feet at Hiyu Mountain. The origin of the natural dam on the west side of the lake is unclear. It has been described as a classic terminal moraine, impounding the waters of a glacial cirque. Certainly the basin is a cirque, but it is now apparent that the natural dam forming the lake consists of a series of flows of basaltic andesite, with a scattering of morainal material on top of the volcanic material. The material forming the dam is very porous and the outflowing stream seeps into the ground a short distance from the lake and emerges about one-half mile later to become the Bull Run River (Raymond 1983). In 1922 a concrete dam and spillway was constructed at the outlet to control discharge and to raise the water level about 20 feet. A number of small, steep streams supply surface inflow to the lake and direct precipitation (annual precipitation = 110 inches) accounts for a large percentage of the water supply. Despite the proximity to Mt. Hood, none of the water in Bull Run Lake or the Bull Run River comes from glaciers on the volcanic peak. Deep canyons of the West Fork of Hood River and the Sandy River lie between the Bull Run drainage basin and the Mt. Hood drainage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nearly a century of protection has permitted the preservation of the small Bull Run drainage basin in a natural state. The slopes are covered with a virgin conifer forest, with the exception of a few areas of bare talus slope and talus shrub communities. This elevation in the Cascades coincides with the transition zone between the true fir and hemlock vegetation associations, with some Douglas fir. In 1966 the 361-acre Bull Run Research Natural Area was established on the south and eastern slopes above the lake to provide continued protection and research opportunities in this natural area which is essentially free of any human disturbance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As noted, access to Bull Run Lake is strictly controlled to minimize human contamination of the water; thus, the drainage basin is pristine and the water quality is excellent. Concentrations of chemical constituents are very low, although the water is not as dilute as in some other Cascade Mountain lakes that receive human use, specifically Big Lake and Waldo Lake. Conductivity and alkalinity are low, and transparency of the water is high. Moderate populations of diatoms develop in the lake, dominated by Cyclotella stelligera and Melosira distans. Thermal stratification develops in the water column with water as cold as 39 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) below a depth of 75 feet at all times of the year. The low phosphorus and chlorophyl concentrations and the high water transparency indicate an oligotrophic state. A detailed paleolimnological study (Raymond 1983) indicates that chemical and biological conditions in Bull Run Lake today are similar to conditions existing over the past several thousand years. The sediment record provides evidence of temporary changes in limnological conditions in the lake resulting from volcanic activity at nearby Mt. Hood or Mt. St. Helens and from forest fires during periods of area-wide drought conditions. The sediment record also indicates that after such disturbances, the lake has always returned to. conditions similar to those seen at present.</p>

"Smith Reservoir","263","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Smith Reservoir, located in the rugged western Cascades east of Eugene, can be reached by a two-mile gravel road from U.S. Highway 126 at Trail Bridge Reservoir. Part of the Smith-Carmen Hydroelectric Project, this artificial lake was built in 1963 by the Eugene Water and Electric Board to provide storage for power production. Water for the reservoir is first taken from the McKenzie River at Carmen Diversion Dam, delivered to Smith Reservoir by tunnel, and then delivered by tunnel downslope to Carmen Power Plant and Trail Bridge Re-regulating Reservoir.</p>
<p>In addition to inflow from the McKenzie River, the reservoir also receives a significant amount of inflow from Smith River, which drains a deeply dissected area of andesite and basalt. Vegetation cover is a dense forest of Douglas fir and western hemlock and the basin is entirely within the Willamette National Forest. The Wildcat Mountain Research Natural Area lies within the basin. The Northern Spotted Owl, an endangered species, is reported to use this region for nesting. Steep slopes have effectively limited human activity and development in the basin. A 17-unit campground is located at the northern end of the reservoir and is accessible only by boat or on foot. Smith Reservoir is stocked annually with rainbow trout, and boats can be launched from a site near the dam. A 10 mile per hour speed limit for boats is enforced.</p>
<p>Major ion concentrations and conductivity are about average for water bodies in the Cascades. The depth of the reservoir, combined with the short hydrologic retention time, prevents any significant biological growth. &nbsp;Therefore, chlorophyl concentrations are low and water transparency is very high. &nbsp;Smith Reservoir is classified as oligotrophic. It is interesting to note that the phosphorus concentration is much higher than in most other reservoirs of the Willamette River Basin, but it is consistent with water bodies in the Upper McKenzie River drainage, e.g. Trailbridge Reservoir, and Clear Lake.</p>

"Saunders Lake","258","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Saunders Lake is one of several lakes in an extensive area of sand dunes on the Oregon coast stretching from North Bend to Florence. It is more visible and more heavily used than most in this area because of its proximity to the Oregon Coast Highway. Along with other nearby lakes (including Horsfall and Beale Lakes in this study) it lies in a forested deflation plain on which the sand is stabilized by a dense growth of shrubs and trees, primarily pine and fir. Active dunal ridges, reaching about 100 feet above sea level, flank the plain on both sides and trend north and south parallel to the coast. There are no perennial streams in the area and the lake is a surface expression of seasonal fluctuations in the water table. Saunders Lake is relatively steep sided so changes in surface area are not as great as at other lakes on the deflation plain. Nevertheless, there is a distinct seasonal pattern. At high stages the lake is often connected to Clear Lake, a small 25-acre lake to the north, and there is also some surface outflow to the west. Ground water aquifers in the area are tapped by the Coos Bay North Bend Water Board for industrial use and that activity has had some effect on lake levels. During the 1976-77 drought the natural level of the lake dropped by several feet. For the most part the shoreline of Saunders Lake is private property with many home sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Local residents probably withdraw some water from the lake for domestic use. There is a short stretch of county owned shoreline at the south end and the Department of Fish and Wildlife has provided a boat launching ramp. Fishing success can be had on Saunders Lake, particularly for cutthroat and rainbow trout in the spring and early summer. Yellow perch are also caught in good numbers. The maximum depth of Saunders Lake is 35 feet, but over half the lake is shallower than 10 feet and there is an extensive growth of water lilies and other macrophytes. However, in spite of this fact and the large number of homes around the shoreline, Saunders Lake has a lower trophic state than most of the other coastal lakes. Secchi disk depth, chlorophyll and phosphorus concentrations all indicate mesotrophic conditions, but quite close to oligotrophic.</p>

"Thief Valley Reservoir","273","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Thief Valley Reservoir on the Powder River is an irrigation impoundment constructed in 1932 by the Bureau of Reclamation for the Lower Powder River Irrigation District. It is the key component of the lower division of the Baker Project, and serves as a supplemental water supply for about 7300 acres of agricultural land along the Powder River. Phillips Lake, located about 10 miles southeast of Baker, is the principal component of the Upper Division of the Baker Project. Thief Valley is a little valley east of North Powder, and is the site where John Wetherly was hanged in 1864 for stealing mules from an emigrant at Boise; hence the name of the valley and of the reservoir.</p>
<p>The area receives fairly heavy recreational use from hunters, four-wheelers, and fishermen. A portion of the reservoir area has been set aside for recreation use and is administered by Union County. Camping, picnicking, and boat launching and mooring facilities have been constructed. The reservoir has developed a reputation for good fishing for trout, largemouth bass, and black crappie, all of which have been planted. Unfortunately, there is also an abundance of rough fish. The headwater portion of the drainage basin is within the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, while the lower reaches are a mixture of private and federal (Bureau of Land Management) land used mostly for grazing. The shoreline of the reservoir, except for the county recreation area, is in federal ownership.</p>
<p>Thief Valley Reservoir is approximately two miles long, one-half mile wide, and covers an area of 740 acres when full. Since the construction of Mason Dam (Phillips Lake) upstream, surface area at minimum pool is approximately 200 acres. At full pool, maximum depth is 38 feet and much of the reservoir is less than 20 feet deep. There are frequent strong afternoon winds which cause resuspension of bottom sediment which increases turbidity and clouds the water.</p>
<p>The climate of the region is dry, and the concentrations of ions in the water are fairly high. Conductivity and alkalinity are above average for eastern Oregon reservoirs, and pH is frequently above 8. There is a noticeable tendency for oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion. However, most of the reservoir is only weakly stratified and frequently mixed. The concentration of phosphorus is high, and water transparency limited. Algae (<em>Aphanizomenon</em>) bloom in the reservoir during the summer, causing high chlorophyl concentrations. However, the inorganic turbidity probably reduces light availability and thereby limits algal blooms somewhat. Because it is supplied with nutrients and is shallow, Thief Valley Reservoir is eutrophic.</p>

"Blue Lake (156)","156","<p>
<p>(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). Blue Lake is a small, but very deep Cascade Mountain lake, and is often called ""the Crater Lake of the Central Oregon Cascades."" Because of its great depth (maximum depth greater than 300 feet), it is certainly the bluest of the many Blue Lakes in Oregon. The lake basin is an explosion crater formed from a violent steam explosion, a result of hot volcanic rock coming in contact with underground water. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal revealed that the formative blast occurred about 3500 years ago. Blue Lake and nearby Suttle Lake lie in the same broad valley and it was originally assumed that both lie in basins scoured by glaciers. Subsequent study by geologists revealed that only Suttle Lake is glacial in origin; Blue Lake is clearly volcanic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Blue Lake drainage basin is composed of forested slopes that are extremely steep; much of it is actually part of the explosion crater that holds the lake. The lake thus has very little shallow water; only about three percent of the water surface area is less than 10 feet deep. The water in the lake comes from several sources; some is supplied by snowmelt runoff from the surrounding slopes, and one intermittent stream enters from the northwest. However, the source of most of the water that fills Blue Lake is from large springs at about 240 feet below the water surface near the east shore. Link Creek, the outlet stream, has cut through the crater wall on the east and flows about half a mile to Suttle Lake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Blue Lake — Suttle Lake area has long been a favorite with outdoor enthusiasts, and several Forest Service campgrounds are in the area, including one at Blue Lake. Several hiking and horse trails follow the shoreline. Rainbow trout are stocked in the lake each year, and some kokanee are taken. Fishing is best in the warmer months because of the depth of the lake. Elliott R. Corbett Memorial State Park includes part of the south and west shores of Blue Lake. The park is preserved as a wilderness area, with only water and toilet installations provided. Use of the park is light, as it is accessible only by trail. About half of the rocky, forested shoreline is in private ownership, and a private resort is located at the outlet. The area of the Cascades from Blue Lake and Suttle Lake to Sisters and south of U.S. Highway 20 has a checkerboard pattern of privately—owned parcels of land alternating with land under management of the Forest Service. Land use and land management plans must be adjusted to the discontinuous nature of the land ownership pattern.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The water chemistry data for this lake are peculiar. In the water samples collected on 7/21/82 the concentrations of major ions were slightly above average for lakes in the region. Similar concentrations (with less complete data) were observed in samples collected in 1971 by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. However, a water sample collected by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality in October, 1972, contained much higher concentrations of sodium and chloride, with a corresponding increase in conductivity. The explanation for this variability in the data is unknown, but it is possible that the lake receives sporadic inflow from concentrated hydrothermal springs. The concentration of phosphorus is exceptionally high in all samples and, by itself, this high phosphorus concentration would classify the lake as distinctly eutrophic. However, water transparency is high, dissolved oxygen is not depleted in the hypolimnion and except for an occasional bloom the populations of phytoplankton are low and the species are indicators of oligotrophy. &nbsp;All of these factors give the lake a distinct oligotrophic character.&nbsp;</p>

"Blue Lake (Multnomah County)","46","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(From the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Atlas of Oregon Lakes</span>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Blue Lake is a 61 acre natural lake in east Multnomah County that lies parallel to the Columbia River and about 1000 feet south of it. It is a floodplain lake and was formerly connected at high water with the Columbia River, at which time river water ran through the lake into the Columbia Slough. A dike (along which Marine Drive runs) now extends along the south shore of the Columbia, blocking any surface connection with the river. Water flows into the lake primarily from seeps and springs, with the quantity influenced by the changing height of the river. No other inflows exist, except occasional runoff during periods of heavy rains. When the water level of the Columbia River drops, some water loss occurs thorough the lake bottom sediments. In early summer, when the river rises, low-lying lands along the north shore of the lake become soggy and water-soaked, and the level of the lake also rises, greatly increasing the outflow which runs eastward through a short creek into a drainage ditch along the Columbia dike. From here it is pumped back over the dike into the Columbia. The dike itself is of rock and earth construction and quite impermeable; but it lies on a sand base, through which Columbia River water seeps. During high water the pressure from the river side increases the rate of seepage through the sandy substrate. The lake's proximity to metropolitan Portland and its accessibility have made it an important recreational resource for the area. Boating, water-skiing, swimming, fishing, and picnicking have been the most popular recreational activities. The north shore of the lake is part of Blue Lake Park, operated and owned by Multnomah County. The south shore is privately owned and lined with permanent residences. Because of intensive use by lakeside residents and park visitors, Blue Lake water quality has been of concern to Multnomah County and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. Many studies have focused on the problems of Blue Lake (such as the presence of nuisance macrophytes and increased turbidity), and how to manage the lake to maintain water quality standards that would ensure safe and enjoyable recreational use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blue Lake supports a wide variety of plant and animal life. The morphometry of the lake (its shallow depth) and the natural nutrient input from rich lake bottom sediments and groundwater provide ideal conditions for high plant productivity. During the summer months, extensive macrophyte growth, dominated by Eurasian water milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) occurs along the shallow west, north, and east shores of the lake to a depth of 10 feet. The south shore, however, is steeper and does not have an extensive growth of macrophytes. Transparency of the water is decreased during the summer months due to an abundance of microscopic planktonic algal growth dominated by diatoms and blue-green algae. Generally, the more algae present in the lake, the more turbid and green it becomes. Although the plant productivity impairs swimming activities, it has provided food and habitat for the resident zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, and fish. Benthic invertebrates feed on organic detritus and phytoplankton and are an important food source for fish. Fish studies have indicated that black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, carp, and brown bullhead are the major components of the fish population. The bottom muck sediments support benthic organisms tolerant of organically rich, low oxygen conditions. A total of seventeen benthic invertebrate taxa were identified, with crawfish and naiads (freshwater mussels) being the most common organisms observed (BEAK 1983). Densities of bacteria, another important biological component in Blue Lake, do not exceed state water quality standards for water contact recreation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The values of physical and chemical water quality parameters, such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient concentrations, change seasonally in Blue Lake. Although the lake is relatively shallow, typical thermal stratification occurs during the spring and summer months. On a given summer day, surface temperatures may reach 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius) above the thermocline, and be reduced to 61 degrees Fahrenheit (16 degrees Celsius) at the bottom. As thermal stratification occurs and water temperatures increase, the dissolved oxygen levels decrease in the hypolimnion. Values may vary from 10.8 mg/l at the surface to 0.5 mg/l at the bottom, causing a near anoxic zone to form. This nearly anoxic zone remains until fall turnover, when winds and cold weather cause the lake to mix and re-oxygenate. The transparency of the water, measured by a Secchi disk, varied from 2.6 feet (0.8 meters) during summer algal blooms, to 13.0 feet (4.0 meters) during periods of low algal growth (BEAK 1983). Nutrients in the Blue Lake water are important in controlling the biological productivity of the lake. Sources of phosphorus, one of the more important nutrients and often the most limited in supply, include rainwater, groundwater, surface runoff, and anoxic sediments. Phosphorus concentrations in Blue Lake range from 0.04 to 0.6 mg/l which in conjunction with other indicators, classifies the lake as eutrophic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Historically, Blue Lake has been used recreationally since the early 1800 s by the Nechockee Indians. Lakewide habitation and more intensive use of the lake has occurred since the 1930s when Blue Lake Park was developed by private residents. Multnomah County purchased the park along the north shore in 1960 and has maintained the recreational facility, renewing docks and picnic areas, and building a public swim center. Peak use occurred in 1974 when 666,000 visitors participated in recreational fishing and swimming. However, swim center fees imposed in 1975, followed by closure of the lake to swimming in 1976 due to high turbidity and macrophyte growth, caused a decline in park use since then. Through efforts and funds from Multnomah County and Environmental Protection Agency, the water quality problems were studied and a rehabilitation and management plan was developed in 1982 (BEAK 1983). Control of macrophyte growth has been attempted using a variety of strategies. In the late 1960s, harvesting failed to reduce or control the macrophytes. During the winter of 1981-82, the lake level was lowered by 8 feet to expose the macrophytes to freezing temperatures and ideally kill the roots and prevent growth the following spring. The drawdown was successful and a significant decrease in macrophyte growth resulted in the summer of 1982. In addition, macrophyte growth was controlled by the application of the herbicide 2,4-D. The reduction of the macrophytes allowed the swim center to re-open, and swimming was permitted once again during the summer of 1983. Dilution water will probably be pumped into Blue Lake beginning in 1984. This may eventually increase water transparency and control nuisance algal blooms.&nbsp;</p>

"Minam Lake","235","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Minam Lake is located high in the Eagle Cap Wilderness at the head of the Lostine River. It is remarkable because of the fact that it has an outlet at either end. Minam River flows from the south end and Lostine River from the north. This unusual situation is due to the artificial modification of what was formerly a small natural lake. Early in this century a 14-foot high dam was constructed across the natural outlet to the south, thereby enlarging the lake and deflecting the drainage to the north. The purpose of creating the reservoir was to provide irrigation for agricultural lands in the Lostine Valley and to provide some water for domestic use. The meadow in which Minam Lake lies is a lovely site surrounded by the rugged peaks of the Wallowa Mountains. It is a favorite destination for wilderness travellers and there are several undeveloped campsites along the east shore of the lake. Fishing for brook trout is excellent from July through September.</p>
<p>The pre-existing natural lake was located near the center of the present enlarged lake. Accordingly, the maximum depth occurs where the natural lake was located, rather than near the face of the dam, as is typical of reservoirs. The lake develops a weak thermal stratification during the summer. Because of the high altitude (7370 feet), surface temperatures remain very cool (60 degrees Fahrenheit; 15 degrees Celsius). Water quality is excellent, and the concentration of chemical constituents is very low. Only the concentration of calcium ion exceeds a milligram per liter. Water transparency is excellent (26 feet; 8 meters) and the concentrations of chlorophyl and phosphorus are low. There is evidence of a limited amount of oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion. In summary, Minam Lake is distinctly oligotrophic.</p>

"Cultus Lake","62","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Cultus Lake is a beautiful, natural lake located high on the east slope of the Cascades in the upper Deschutes River Basin. It is one of many popular recreation lakes accessible from the Cascade Lakes Highway, and is reached on a good paved road two miles west of the highway. The word ""cultus"" is used in many places in the Pacific Northwest. It is a Chinook jargon word, very expressive, meaning bad or apparently worthless. With regard to this pristine, unproductive lake, it probably referred to the poor fishing conditions that existed. Cultus Mountain, a symmetrical cone rising to an elevation of 6759 feet immediately to the south was doubtless named for the lake. Little Cultus Lake is on the south side of the mountain.</p>
<p>The drainage basin contributing to the lake is volcanic terrain with low to moderate slopes covered with a dense, mixed conifer forest. The entire area is within the Deschutes National Forest, much of it within the Three Sisters Wilderness. Ponderosa pine dominates in the lower elevations with more firs closer to the Cascade divide. In the forest on the north side of the lake is an extensive marsh area. Numerous small lakes are located in the drainage basin, the largest being Deer Lake to the south, Irish and Taylor Lakes near the summit, and Winopee Lake to the north. The area contributes surface inflow to Cultus Lake through a number of intermittent streams; the largest is Winopee Creek which enters through the marsh on the north side. There is also a substantial amount of subsurface seepage into the lake through the permeable volcanic terrain. Springs have been noted along both the south and north shorelines. Outflow is at the southeast end into Cultus Creek which enters Crane Prairie Reservoir about two miles downstream. The lake basin itself is long and narrow, about three miles long and one and one-half miles wide, oriented west to east, a typical shape for a lake basin scoured out by glacial activity. Maximum depths occur in the eastern end of the basin (maximum depth = 211 feet), while the western half of the lake is nowhere more than 125 feet deep. Both the eastern and western ends have shallow, sandy bottoms, creating very favorable swimming conditions. Otherwise the bottom is a mixture of coarse sand, muck, and organic detritus.</p>
<p>Vehicle access to Cultus Lake is limited from late October to late May each year due to snow-blocked roads. However, during the summer season it is a popular recreation site; water skiing and boating are particularly popular activities because it is one of the few lakes in the area without a speed limit on boats. Angling for rainbow trout is fair, and they are taken mostly by trolling. There are many white fish in the lake as well as a few mackinaw. A nice private resort with cabins, boats, and supplies is located near the outlet, and there are three good Forest Service campgrounds, two with boat launches. West Cultus Lake campground is accessible only by boat or trail. All have good swimming beaches.</p>
<p>Cultus Lake is ultraoligotrophic, with a recorded transparency of 56 feet (17.2 meters) on 8/20/81. The lack of any substantial amounts of phytoplankton or macrophytes similarly indicates ultraoligotrophic conditions. With respect to transparency and phytoplankton density, Cultus Lake is quite similar to Waldo Lake and Big Lake, two other large ultraoligotrophic lakes in the Cascades. However, the concentrations of major ions, the alkalinity, and the conductivity are appreciably higher in Cultus Lake, although still below average for Cascade lakes in general. The higher concentrations of major ions may be attributed to the swampy drainage on the north side of the lake through which Winopee Creek enters, or to subsurface springs which normally have high concentrations of major ions. Concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyl are extremely low, consistent with the ultraoligotrophic state. The lake stratifies in summer, with the thermocline generally occurring at about 35 feet (11 meters).</p>
<p>In general, this ultraoligotrophic lake (as well as other similar lakes such as Waldo Lake and Big Lake) seems not to be adversely affected by the high amount of recreational activity. It is generally considered that ultraoligotrophic lakes are very sensitive to cultural influences, but several factors appear to be ""absorbing"" any perturbations to Cultus, Waldo, and Big Lakes. First, these lakes contain a very large volume of water that dilutes any elevated nutrient sources. Second, these lakes are in a sub-alpine environment, with only a very short ""growing season"", and the overall biological productivity is probably limited more by these physical factors than by nutrient availability. These observations have not been verified, but they seem quite likely. Future lake management efforts should address this possibility of physical limitations to accelerated eutrophication so that unnecessary attempts at controlling algal nutrients may be avoided.</p>

"North Twin Lake","244","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;North and South Twin Lakes are a pair of high country lakes in the headwaters of the Deschutes River Basin. They lie just east of the Deschutes River and immediately north of Wickiup Reservoir. Both lakes are nearly circular in shape, about one-half mile in diameter, and are of volcanic origin. North Twin Lake formed when rising magma within the earth's crust came in contact with groundwater. The resulting explosion left behind a crater that later filled with water. There is no surface inflow to or outflow from the lake; water enters by seepage and direct precipitation, and is lost by seepage and evaporation. The hydrologic retention time, estimated as 19 years, is among the highest for lakes in this survey. Maximum depth of the lake is over 60 feet and there is relatively little shallow water. A large number of dead trees stand in the shallow area near the shoreline, indicating significant fluctuation in water level in past years.</p>
<p>The Twin Lakes have long been known for good fishing and were even visited by former President Hoover for this purpose in 1940. North Twin Lake is heavily stocked each year and the results have been excellent. Rainbow trout are the most plentiful, and there are also kokanee salmon and cutthroat trout. A more rustic recreational experience is available at North Twin Lake in contrast to South Twin Lake, and use is accordingly less. There is a nice Forest Service campground on the north shore, but no other facilities exist. No motorboats are allowed on the lake.</p>
<p>The concentrations of major ions in North Twin Lake are fairly high, and the conductivity is well above average. Sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium concentrations are the highest for any of the Cascade lakes included in this survey. The pH of the water is also slightly above average. The concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyl are moderate, and water transparency is good. There is some tendency for oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion. Although the water transparency indicates that North Twin is oligotrophic, other water quality characteristics identify the lake as mesotrophic.</p>

"Dog Lake","186","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Dog Lake lies at an elevation of 5197 feet above sea level in the Goose Lake drainage basin. It was formerly called Dogleg Lake because of its shape, and the name has been contracted as a matter of convenience. It lies within the boundaries of the Fremont National Forest, but until recently most of the lakeshore was privately owned land. All land around the lake is now owned by the federal government, and it is a popular recreation site. Fishing is good for rainbow trout, largemouth bass, crappie, perch, and catfish. Two Forest Service campgrounds and a boat launch are available for visitor use. Dog Lake has been described by the Nature Conservancy as a rare example of a medium size, mid-montane, freshwater lake which is both accessible and in near natural condition. Excellent examples of both floating and rooted macrophytes are present, and the site is known for the waterfowl nesting habitat of the marshes lining the shore. Adjacent to the lake are herb-grass meadows which grade into the surrounding open Ponderosa pine-western juniper-low sagebrush forest.</p>
<p>The surface area of Dog Lake changes considerably during the year and from one year to another. At maximum extent it is nearly 500 acres. The data presented here indicate a surface area of 189 acres, mean depth of 13.5 feet, and maximum depth of 22 feet. This is deeper than other lakes in the area; hence the trophic state is lower than other lakes in the Goose/Summer Basin. Nevertheless, it is a naturally eutrophic lake, although at the lower end. The major ion concentrations, conductivity, and alkalinity are lower than average for the area, as are phosphorus and chlorophyl concentrations. Water transparency is good (9.2 feet; 2.8 meters); however, algal blooms of Microcystis and Anabaena frequently lower this transparency. The lake was not stratified on the date of sampling (7/6/82), but the bottom water was nevertheless devoid of oxygen. The lake bottom is largely peat and plant debris from the macrophyte beds, and this undoubtedly causes this dissolved oxygen depletion.</p>

"Fish Lake (197)","197","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Fish Lake is a large reservoir located at the foot of beautiful Mt. McLoughlin in the southern Oregon Cascades. It was formed from a small natural lake, which was considerably enlarged in 1915 by the construction of a rock-faced, earthfill dam on the North Fork of Little Butte Creek. Built by the Bureau of Reclamation, it is now a part of the Medford Irrigation District. There is no significant natural surface flow into the lake, this being a region of highly permeable volcanic materials where groundwater movement dominates. Since 1923 water has been diverted from Fourmile Lake in the Klamath River Basin through the Cascade Canal, and discharged into the lava terrain about one and one-half miles above Fish Lake. There it seeps in and reappears as springs at the head of the lake. The outflow into the North Fork of Little Butte Creek is used for irrigation near Eagle Point and Medford.</p>
<p>Fish Lake was designed as a multi-purpose facility and it has become well known as a recreation area. Swimming, boating, camping and fishing draw large numbers of visitors. The shoreline is entirely in federal ownership and the Forest Service maintains two campgrounds, picnic areas and boat launching facilities. On the east end of the lake is a private resort with cabins, a store and trailer spaces. There are also about 30 summer homes around the shore on land leased from the Forest Service.</p>
<p>The lake is relatively shallow, with a mean depth of 18 feet and a maximum depth of only 31 feet at full pool. The shape is elongate, but less branched than is usual for a reservoir. The concentrations of major ions are lower than average for lakes in the Rogue River Basin; conductivity and alkalinity are among the lowest. In spite of the shallow depths, no significant growth of submerged macrophytes has developed. The concentration of phosphorus is somewhat above average and algal blooms occur regularly. Water transparency varies considerably throughout the year and at times is greater than in most other lakes of the Rogue River Basin. The relatively high elevation may help to diminish any tendency for advancing trophic conditions in Fish Lake and it is classified as mesotrophic.</p>

"Crater Lake","56","<p>
<p>(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). Crater Lake is one of the scenic wonders of the American West. The clear blue lake is situated in a volcanic caldera where the top of a larger mountain, Mt. Mazama, collapsed to form a deep depression. The lake is certainly the best known water body in Oregon and lies entirely within Crater Lake National Park, Oregon's only national park. The elevation of the surface is 6176 feet above sea level, and it is the deepest lake in the United States. Maximum depth is reported to be 1932 feet. The highest point on the rim surrounding the lake is Hillman peak, 8156 feet above sea level. Crater Lake was discovered on June 12, 1853, by John W. Hillman and a party of prospectors, and was christened Deep Blue Lake. It has been know at times at Mysterious Lake, Lake Majesty, and other similar names. On August 4, 1869, it was named Crater Lake by a party of visitors from Jacksonville, Oregon. It was not until 1902 that the area received national park status. By 1918 a rough road was completed around the lake, and visitor use increased dramatically -- over 20,000 visitors in 1920. Comfortable, hard-surfaced roads have long since replaced the early, rough roads and more than 600,000 people now visit Crater Lake National Park annually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The geologic origin of Crater Lake has been discussed in many publications. Howell Williams (1942) described ancient Mt. Mazama as:, stratovolcano, formed from lava flows alternating with layers of ejecta from explosive eruptions. In a well-illustrated monograph he depicts ancient Mt. Mazama as a peak rivaling Mt. Hood and Mt. Adams in size, perhaps 12,500 feet in height. Glaciers were present during the Wisconsin stage of the Pleistocene Epoch and eroded U-shaped valleys, now represented by notches on the crater rim. A series of explosive eruptions and readjustments in the magma chamber caused subsidence of the peak, which literally fell in. There were probably many individual adjustments rather than one continuous movement. Carbon-14 dating of charred wood beneath the pumice shows that the climatic eruption occurred approximately 6600 years ago (Baldwin 1976). Subsequent flows of lava covered the bottom of the lake. Later volcanic action and the dying phase of volcanism produced the small cinder cone known as Wizard Island, a volcano within a volcano. There has been some reinterpretation of the eruptive history of Mt. Mazama and of the formation of Crater Lake caldera. Bacon (1983) presents evidence that Mount Mazama actually consisted of a glaciated complex of overlapping shields and stratovolcanoes, each of which was probably active for a comparatively short interval.</p>
<p>Crater Lake is unusual in a number of respects, not the least of which is the hydrologic regime as described by Phillips and Van Denburgh (1968). The topographic drainage basin is defined by the rim of the caldera, a surface area of 26.2 square miles. The water surface is 20.5 square miles or 78 percent of the basin. The floor of the caldera is probably underlain by lava flows somewhat less permeable than the volcanic ejecta of the caldera walls. The new lake probably increased rapidly in depth until it reached a level at which its annual water supply was substantially balanced by losses from leakage and evaporation. The level of the present water surface was attained sometime between 1000 and 4000 years ago. Thus, water is supplied primarily by direct precipitation. No perennial streams flow into the lake and there is obviously no surface outflow. In summer, the melting of accumulated snow produces many rivulets that course down the steep caldera walls into the lake. These streams are not constant in flow, but vary with changes in the rate of snowmelt. Water also enters the lake via springs near the shore and via underground percolation.</p>
<p>Water is lost from the lake by seepage and evaporation only. The points where the waters of Crater Lake are lost and where they reappear at the surface are unknown. Large springs emerge at levels lower than the lake in the basins of the Rogue and Umpqua Rivers and in the tributaries of the Klamath River (Annie Creek, Wood River, and Williamson River). The total flow of these springs is many times the amount of water lost by seepage from the lake. Most of the springs have very steady flow; all are cold and clear, and the streams they feed are low in dissolved-solids content, as is the lake water. However, no direct evidence of hydraulic connection between the lake and any of the springs has been made. The best estimate is that most of the seepage from the lake mingles with underground waters that feed springs in the Klamath River Basin. Changes in lake level are a response to climatic differences from year to year. The highest level ever attained was 6187.4 feet (date unknown), based on botanical evidence. An elevation of 6172.5 feet appears to be the lowest; thus the maximum range in recent centuries is about 16 feet. Total volume of Crater Lake at its average elevation of 6176 feet is 13 million acre feet; that volume represents about 150 times the average annual water supply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another unusual characteristic of Crater Lake is the shape of the lake basin itself. The basin is nearly circular, and a bathymetric survey in 1959 disclosed a rather flat lake floor more than 1500 feet below the water surface from which a conical hill (Merriam Cone) rises to within 500 feet of the surface. The lake has a depth of at least 1920 feet over an area of one &nbsp;square mile. It is the deepest lake in the United States, the second deepest in the western hemisphere (Great Slave Lake in Canada is the deepest), and the seventh deepest in the world.</p>
<p>The water chemistry of Crater Lake is also unusual. Concentrations of chloride and sulfate are anomalously high compared to other lakes in the region. It is thought that the high concentrations of these two anions result from an influx of geothermal water deep in the lake. However, the ratio of chloride to sulfate in the lake is about 1:1 (by weight), whereas this ratio is much higher (3:18) in hot springs in the Cascades. The nutrient chemistry is also unusual. The concentration of nitrate is exceptionally low, seldom exceeding one or two micrograms per liter except very deep in the lake. The concentrations of phosphorus (0.010 to 0.015 mg/l) and silica (10 to 20 milligrams per liter) are much higher, indicating that the phytoplankton in the lake are nitrogen limited.</p>
<p>The thermal properties of Crater Lake do not fit standard limnological definitions (Williams and Herzen 1983). During summer the lake develops a warmer surface layer, as expected, although it seldom exceeds 15 degrees Celsius at any depth. On occasion the surface water is vigorously mixed by storms. Temperature profiles in summer indicate that water temperature below the surface decreases approximately exponentially, falling to 39 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) between 130 and 300 feet (40 and 100 meters) deep. Below 1000 feet (300 meters), however, water temperatures increase with increasing depth. The lake is deep enough that adiabatic temperature changes are significant, and the influx of geothermal water and the warming of the bottom water by geothermal heat further influences water temperatures and vertical mixing. Water chemistry data indicate that the lake is well-mixed, further suggesting the influence of thermal convection. The lake rarely freezes in spite of its altitude and long winters.</p>
<p>Water transparency is much above average, with Secchi-disk observations usually between 82 and 130 feet (25 and 40 meters). The characteristic blue color of the water is primarily due to the optical properties of pure water itself. Pure water is most transparent to blue light (wavelengths of 4000 to 5000 Angstroms), and blue light is also most strongly scattered. Water containing very little particulate or organic matter, such as that in Crater Lake, is characteristically blue.</p>
<p>As implied by the transparency, the population of plankton in the surface water of the lake is low. An unusual feature of the phytoplankton is the depth at which it is found. Among the common phytoplankton, most are found in greatest abundance between 260 and 600 feet (80 and 200 meters) depth, including the common genera Muogeotia, Tribonema, and Stephanodiscus hantzschi. Among the common species, only Nitzschia gracilis is found in greatest abundance in the upper 80 meters (Geiger 1983, personal communication). In addition to those common species, the lake contains an unusually diverse array of less common species of phytoplankton, primarily diatoms. Measurements of productivity by carbon-14 uptake indicate that the highest productivity occurs at greater depths than observed in most lakes (Larson 1976). Measures of productivity per unit volume, oxygen saturation, water transparency, and plankton abundance all clearly indicate that the lake is distinctly oligotrophic. If productivity is added up over the active water column, the productivity per unit area is somewhat greater than is characteristic of ultraoligotrophic lakes, because primary productivity occurs over such a large range of depths. Although the transparency of the surface water would classify the lake as ultraoligotrophic, the other data indicate an oligotrophic classification.</p>

"Magone Lake","230","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Magone Lake is a small natural lake in the Malheur National Forest of east-central Oregon. It lies at an elevation of 5000 feet above sea level in a small, forested drainage basin. The lake basin consists of a single elongate trough oriented north-south. A single intermittent stream, Lake Creek, enters from the north and the outflow is tributary to the East Fork of Beech Creek, which it joins about two miles downstream. The lake was named for Major John W. Magone, a nineteenth century resident of Canyon City who stocked the lake with fish. It is one of the few natural lakes in this part of the state and draws a large number of visitors each year. Most of them come for the fishing; lots of rainbow trout and brook trout are taken, and there reportedly are a few kokanee. The lake is open all year, and winter fishing through the ice is popular. A good Forest Service campground is located on the shore and boats can be launched easily. However, there is no fishing from motorboats, and a 10 mph speed limit on the water is enforced.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The concentrations of ions in Magone Lake are somewhat above average for Oregon lakes, except for the few lakes in areas of interior drainage. The concentrations of calcium and magnesium are particularly high, making the water relatively hard for surface water in Oregon. The lake becomes strongly stratified in summer, with a thermocline between 16 and 33 feet (5 and 10 meters). The deeper water is anoxic by late summer. Water transparency, total phosphorus and chlorophyl concentrations indicate that the lake is mesotrophic, although the strong depletion of oxygen in the hypolimnion would seem to indicate a more eutrophic lake. However, there are many submerged logs on the bottom and their decomposition may be responsible for the oxygen depletion.</p>

"Devils Lake","68","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Devils Lake lies immediately east of Lincoln City on the Oregon Coast. It is entirely within the Lincoln City Urban Growth Boundary, and portions of the western shoreline are within the city limits. the lower reaches of the lake are less than 300 yards from the active beach zone of the Pacific Ocean. The lake is approximately three miles long, running north and south, and averages about 0.4 miles in width. It was named because of an Indian legend which tells that a giant fish or marine monster lived in the lake and occasionally came to the surface to attack some hapless native.</p>
<p>Devils Lake was formed when sand dunes and beach deposits of the late Pleistocene Epoch blocked the lower end of the valley drained by the D River. Since the lake surface elevation is substantially above sea level (elevation = 20 feet on USGS topographic map) a freshwater lake now exists, rather than a brackish water estuary. The single outflow from the lake, the D River, drops to the Pacific Ocean. It is listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the ""world's shortest river."" The largest inflows from the forested drainage basin are two streams, Rock Creek and Thompson Creek. Rock Creek, the principal source of surface inflow, drains about 60 percent of the basin. It drains an area of predominately undeveloped, forested, steep sloped, mountainous terrain; however, the lower portion is used for cattle grazing and the upper area is managed for timber. Thompson Creek drains the moderately sloped northern portion of the drainage basin, and is an area in which land uses are principally developed residential and livestock grazing.</p>
<p>The recreational value of a freshwater lake adjacent to the local beach environment and adjacent to a growing population center is very high. Lincoln City maintains several municipal properties on Devils Lake and the state of Oregon operates parks near the south end. Devils Lake State Park has two public use areas. East Devils Lake Park is available for day use and boat launching. Devils Lake Campground is located on the southwest side of the lake, less than half a mile from the Oregon Coast Highway. Lincoln City owns and maintains three smaller parks on the lake.</p>
<p>Fishing in the lake has been successful off and on over the years. It has been treated several times because of a large number of carp. After treatment it will produce good catches of cutthroat and rainbow trout and largemouth bass, and a good population of catfish has developed. However, fishing pressure is fairly light during the summer due to the presence of speedboats and water-skiing in portions of the lake and due to massive macrophyte beds growing to the surface in the other portions.</p>
<p>Water quality in Devils Lake is poor and it is classified as eutrophic. Because of its proximity to the ocean the water shows the influence of sea spray in the slightly elevated concentrations of sodium and chloride. McHugh (1979) included the lake in his study of highly eutrophic lakes in Oregon, and his observations are summarized as follows: Devils Lake has been a problem area for many years. Until 1970 it had the dubious distinction of being the worst polluted lake in the state, as the south end was frequently contaminated by a poorly functioning sewage treatment plant, a situation which has since been corrected. Repeated surveys have found areas with high nutrient levels and coliform counts. Septic systems from homes in the unsewered areas or still functioning in the sewered areas contribute to the problem. In addition, the two creeks flowing into the lake pass through farm yards and cattle pastures have been found to contain high levels of nutrients and bacteria. These contributions compound the problems of excessive algae and macrophyte growth found in the lake. To reduce these contributions, McHugh recommended developing sewers in the unsewered portions of the drainage basin and discontinuing the use of septic systems.</p>
<p>Another major problem with the lake has been rapid shoaling, caused by siltation and heavy macrophyte growth. Part of the silt has originated from areas in which the forest and shrub ground cover has&nbsp;been disturbed, as in road building and house construction. Some doubtless enters the lake through inflowing streams. Silting tends to be periodic, following heavy rains. During the 1964 floods, a shallow bay off the lake received approximatley three feet of silt in two days. Macrophyte growth has been heavy around the lake margins, where the water is shallow, and in similar areas at the north and south ends. The dense stands of plants die each winter, and the more resistant plant material sinks to the bottom to form peat. At times in the past, waterfront land owners have used an underwater weed cutter, but as these cut-off plant parts were not removed from the lake, they simply added to the peat deposits. The plant beds probably also contribute to silting by slowing water movement through the lake, so that mud entering through tributary streams tends to settle out in the lake, rather than move through it to the outlet.</p>
<p>Local concern for rehabilitation of the lake led to an EPA-funded study (Kramer, Chin, and Mayo 1983) to: 1) identify and quantify the magnitude of the pollution sources and determine their impacts on the lake, 2) analyze and rank alternative control strategies to correct the pollution problems defined in the sampling and monitoring program, and 3) develop a rehabilitation program that is viable, environmentally acceptable and for which funding can be secured for implementation through some local, state, federal and/or private source. Several rehabilitation measures were considered: 1) in-lake rehabilitation such as dredging, plant harvesting, herbicide application, and varying water levels and 2) source control measures such as surrounding land use changes, implementing agricultural forest management, and animal waste disposal practices, rerouting Rock Creek, and sewering all the homes around the lake. Recommended actions included reducing nutrient inflow through use of better agricultural practices, dredging the south end of the lake to remove nutrient enriched sediments and deepen the lake, applying herbicides to kill the weeds in selected areas, and developing a weed harvesting program. Since EPA's Phase II implementation funding has been reduced, Lincoln City, with strong local homeowner support, is pursuing formation of a service district with taxing authority that could implement an annual lake management program.</p>

"Three Creek Lake","275","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Three Creek Lake is a beautiful and pristine mountain lake located high in the Central Oregon Cascades. Although it is a natural lake, the water level is controlled by a small dam constructed at the outlet in the 1930s. About a mile north of the lake is a meadow where three streams (the outfall of Three Creek Lake, that of Little Three Creek Lake, and Snow Ditch Creek) come together to form Three Creek. The natural flow of the stream runs north past Three Creek Butte and into Squaw Creek; however, most of the water is diverted south of Three Creek Butte into the continuation of Snow Creek Ditch and eventually into Tumalo Creek. The water is used for irrigation of agricultural land north of Bend. Three Creek Lake thus serves for storage of irrigation waters, in addition to its role as a recreation site. It is a very popular destination for outdoor recreationists, although it is usually not accessible until June. The lake supports both eastern brook trout and rainbow trout. The rainbow trout are stocked annually by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, but the population of brook trout is self-sustaining. No motorboats are allowed on the water. Excellent angling is also available at nearby Little Three Creek Lake.</p>
<p>A very dramatic backdrop to Three Creek Lake is formed by Tam McArthur Rim, a semi-circular volcanic cliff above the lake on the south side. Lewis Ankeny ""Tam"" McArthur (1883 - 1951) made substantial contributions to the establishment of accurate Oregon geographic and historic data, and was the original author of Oregon Geographic Names, an essential book for those interested in the history and geography of the state. The glacially-carved rim is the dominant feature in the small, steep drainage basin that contributes surface runoff to the lake. Two small streams contribute inflow primarily in response to snowmelt in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Water chemistry in Three Creek Lake is typical of mountain lakes in the Cascades, with low concentrations of ions, alkalinity, and conductivity. Phosphorus and chlorophyl concentrations are also low and the transparency is high; the bottom is visible even at the deepest portion of the lake. Because of the high altitude, water temperatures remain quite low even in summer, and biological productivity is low. By all indicators, Three Creek Lake is oligotrophic.</p>

"Trillium Lake","281","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Trillium Lake is a popular recreational lake located on the south slope of Mount Hood in the Salmon River drainage basin. It was originally a small seven acre water body named Mud Lake, the source of Mud Creek. About 1960 the present lake of about 57 acres was created by the damming of Mud Creek. It has been developed as a fishing lake through the combined efforts of the Isaac Walton League, the Forest Service, and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. A water-right certificate was issued for storage of 352.7 acre-feet for public fishing. Rainbow trout are planted yearly and is the species caught most commonly. The lake also supports brook trout and cutthroat trout. &nbsp;All are stocked, as there is no opportunity for spawning. It is considered a good fly-fishing site because of all the shallow water.</p>
<p>A Forest Service campground and picnic area are maintained on the east shore of Trillium Lake; a boat ramp is available and only boats without motors are allowed. Proximity to the heavily travelled Oregon Highway 26 has meant heavy recreational use over the years and the area is also popular with cross-country skiers in winter. Trillium Lake is easily seen from the front porch of Timberline Lodge and for this reason is one of the more recognizable lakes in the state.</p>
<p>The lake is shallow and lies in a meadow that includes some swampy areas, although it is flanked by high, forested ridges. During the summer of 1977 the lake nearly dried up due to drought. There is a considerable growth of pond lilies and macrophytes in the shallow areas. In spite of the shallow depth the lake develops a definite thermal stratification in the summer because of its sheltered location. The water transparency is influenced by dissolved organic matter from the swampy portions of the drainage basin and by the presence of diatoms. The transparency is thus somewhat less than for most other Oregon Cascade lakes and indicates a mesotrophic state. The species of diatoms present in the water also indicate mesotrophic conditions. Lakes similar to Trillium (i.e. relatively shallow with a mud bottom) at lower elevations would typically be dominated by blue-green algae during the summer months. At the elevation of Trillium Lake, water temperatures are generally too low to encourage blue-green algal blooms. Dissolved organic matter, diatom growth and thermal stratification sometimes lead to a pronounced oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion.</p>

"Lost Lake","94","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). Lost Lake is one of the premier mountain lakes of Oregon, one of the best known to residents of northwestern Oregon, and certainly one of the most photographed. It is scenically located between the Columbia River Gorge and towering Mt. Hood. To the Indians, the lake was known as E-e-kwahl-a-mat-yan-ishkt, which translates as ""Heart of the Mountains"". It was for a long time a favorite summer and autumn campground of the Indians. According to legend, one evening during a summer potlatch, a snow-white doe pursued by wolves suddenly broke from a thicket, plunged into the lake, swam to the middle, dove beneath the surface, and disappeared. A medicine man pronounced this a bad omen. The Indians broke camp and never returned to the lake. In 1912 a young Indian couple who did not share the beliefs of their elders came here to camp. During a storm a bolt of lightening struck the tree under which they were standing and killed the young woman.</p>
<p>Early pioneers travelling the Walk Up Trail from the Columbia River to the Sandy River probably saw the lake as early as the 1850s. The origin of the name Lost Lake is a bit obscure. According to one account, it was originally known as Blue Lake. Another account, printed in Mazama in December 1920, states that the lake was discovered by Joe and John Divers. Acting on information gathered from these two men by E.L. Smith of Hood River, a party of twelve was organized in August 1880 for the purpose of finding the lake. It was found and christened Lost Lake, now one of several in the state of Oregon with the same name.</p>
<p>Lost Lake sits at the head of a steep valley scoured by glaciers, a setting similar to nearby Blue Lake to the west and Bull Run Lake to the south. However, in contrast to these two lakes, it formed behind a lava dam, a result of the eruption of Lava Lake Butte, which blocked the valley and impounded the water. It is likely that a lake already existed in the glacial valley and that the lava dam changed its shape and raised the water level. The only significant surface inflow is from a cluster of streams on the west side known as Inlet Creek, a marshy area. Numerous springs on the east and west sides also contribute to the lake. The abundance of springs is due to the thin topsoil on the basin slopes over a dense volcanic hardpan. Outflow is into the Lake Branch of the West Fork of Hood River on the north end. A three-foot high spillway at the outlet controls the water level to some degree.</p>
<p>The small drainage basin is made up of steep slopes covered by a thick coniferous forest, a mixture of Pacific silver fir, mountain hemlock, western red cedar, Douglas fir, and some white pine. The thin, rocky topsoil restricts the root growth of large trees and, in soils saturated with heavy rains, many trees are found toppled around the shoreline. Western red cedar are prevalent in the marshy areas adjoining the lake. Vine maple, devil's club, and deer fern grow near the springs, and skunk cabbage thrives in the marsh. A wide variety of wild flowers are found near the lake. Cut-leaf bugbane is a wildflower native only to Lost Lake and grows near the inlet. This marshy area is inhabited by salamanders, insects, and occasionally river otter and beaver.</p>
<p>The morphometry of Lost Lake is a result of its geologic origin. It is an extremely deep lake (maximum depth = 175 feet), the deepest in the Mt. Hood National Forest. The lake basin is a continuation of steep ridges that flank it on two sides; Butcher Knife Ridge and Lost Lake Butte are on the east. The Cascade Crest forms the divide between Lost Lake and Bull Run Lake.</p>
<p>Recreational opportunities have made Lost Lake one of the most appealing in the northern Oregon Cascades, and thousands of visitors each year enjoy the variety of opportunities. A three-mile hiking trail surrounds the lake and includes boardwalks and footbridges over the marshy areas on the west side, most of them built in 1974. A small portion of this section has been set aside as a re-vegetation area. The Mt. Hood National Forest maintains a large campground at the lake which is equipped with chemical toilets. A commercial resort on the north end offers cabins, boats and supplies during the recreation season. Boats are available for rent, but no motorboats are permitted on the water. Fishing is for both native and stocked species; German brown trout, kokanee salmon, brook trout and rainbow trout are native, but populations are maintained by stocking rainbow and brook trout. Brown trout are generally found in the deeper portions of the lake.</p>
<p>Water quality in Lost Lake, as can be expected in a deep mountain lake, is excellent. Thermal stratification in summer is pronounced and water temperatures are usually cool. While the surface temperatures will generally reach 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius), in the summer, below 50 to 65 feet (15-20 meters) it is about 39 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) all year. The concentrations of major ions are low, similar to other lakes on the north slope of Mt. Hood, for example Bull Run Lake and Wahtum Lake in this report. Alkalinity (8 mg/1) and conductivity (10 mhos/cm) are also low. These factors, incombination with low concentrations of total phosphorus and chlorophyl and high water transparency, all indicate oligotrophic conditions. Biological productivity in the lake is limited and it could not support the heavy fishing pressure without being stocked by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. Algae observed in the past (net collections) include: <em>Tabellaria flocculosa, Asterionella formosa, Stauroneis phoenicenteron, Gomphonema constrictum, </em>and <em>Ceratium hirondinella</em>. The nannoplankton is dominated by <em>Chroulina</em> (93.9%), which is typical of Cascade mountain oligotrophic lakes. Although the density is moderately high, <em>Chromulina</em> is an extremely small alga; the total phytoplankton biomass is accordingly very low.</p>
<p>Lost Lake is very deep and is not susceptible to change in trophic status from the small contribution of nutrients generated by recreational activity at the lake. Unless there is a considerable extension of facilities, or unless motor boats are allowed, the trophic level will remain low.</p>

"Ochoco Reservoir","246","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Ochoco Reservoir is a large impoundment in Central Oregon, located on Ochoco Creek on the west slope of the Ochoco Mountains. The project was completed by the Ochoco Irrigation District in 1921 for the purpose of providing storage for the irrigation of agricultural lands in the Prineville area. In 1949, the dam was rehabilitated and enlarged by the Bureau of Reclamation. The reservoir now has a storage capacity of 46,500 acre feet at full pool and a surface area of 1100 acres, according to U.S. Bureau of Reclamation data. Approximately 19,500 acres are irrigated with the combined waters from Ochoco and Prineville Reservoirs. Inflow to the reservoir is from Ochoco Creek, Mill Creek, and some other small intermittent streams. Outflow is into Ochoco Creek and the Ochoco Feed Canal. The name Ochoco is used for several geographic features in Central Oregon and is said to be the name of a Snake or Paiute chief. Another version is that the chief was named for the stream because he lived nearby, and that the word ""ochoco"" is a local term for willows.</p>
<p>The drainage basin for the reservoir consists mainly of forest land within the Ochoco National Forest. The lower portion of the basin is mostly private rangeland, as is most of the shoreline. On the north shore is Ochoco Lake State Park with a resort, marina, camping areas, and picnic grounds. Recreational use is heavy and good rainbow trout fishing has been available in recent years. However, Ochoco Reservoir has a long history of fishery problems. It was treated in 1968 to remove scrapfish, and treated again in 1973. By 1974 the reservoir was back in production after being restocked. It is open all year and fish are caught at any season. Ice fishing is also popular in the winter.</p>
<p>The canyon walls near the dam are steep, but slopes are much more gentle at the upper (eastern) end of the reservoir where Ochoco Creek and Mill Creek enter. At the eastern end extensive mudflats are exposed when the reservoir is drawn-down and water level does fluctuate greatly throughout the year because of irrigation withdrawals. Accordingly, there are no extensive growths of macrophytes even in the shallow water. The concentrations of ions are fairly high because of the arid climate. During the summer there are extensive blooms of cyanophytes (<em>Aphanizomenon flos-aquae</em>) which drive up the pH of the water. The concentration of phosphorus is high and is partially responsible for the phytoplankton growth. Possible sources of nutrients are from animal wastes and fertilizers. Water transparency is limited because of the phytoplankton blooms and the presence of suspended inorganic sediment. The reservoir is eutrophic.</p>

"Strawberry Lake","268","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Strawberry Lake is located in the Strawberry Mountain Wilderness, an area of about 50 square miles in the Malheur National Forest of eastern Oregon. It is an area with an interesting and complex geologic history. The Strawberry Mountains were built by igneous intrusions and volcanic activity. Strawberry Mountain, for example, is the erosional remnant of a much larger volcano. During the Pleistocene Epoch the mountains were glaciated, forming the spectacular variety of landforms seen today. Strawberry Mountain, 9038 feet above sea level, dominates the small wilderness, which is sprinkled with high mountain meadows and small lakes. Strawberry Lake, which is the largest, lies in a glacial valley. However, it was actually formed by the impoundment of Strawberry Creek behind a landslide dam. The lake overflows the dam of jumbled rock only at high water levels. Otherwise, water seeps through the rock, reappearing at the surface several -hundred feet downsteam.</p>
<p>Strawberry Lake is only a short hike from the wilderness boundary and serves as a base from which to explore the rest of the region. The lower end of Strawberry Lake is a popular spot on summer weekends, and trails lead around the lake and into the high country. Unfortunately, overuse of the area around the south end of the lake has necessitated restrictions on camping within 100 feet of the shore. The lake is open for fishing all year, but is sometimes not accessible because of heavy snow. There is good angling for brook trout, with some rainbow trout also taken. An early rancher named Strawberry Creek for the wild strawberries growing along its bank; the name gradually spread to the mountain and the lake.</p>
<p>Strawberry Lake is very shallow; nearly the entire southern half of the lake is less than 10 feet deep; and it thus has little tendency to develop thermal stratification. Major ion concentrations in the lake are quite low. However, the concentration of phosphorus is surprisingly high and would seem to indicate a rather eutrophic lake, although other indicators do not support this classification. The water remains sufficiently transparent for the bottom to be visible even at the maximum depth, 27 feet. There is no evidence of oxygen depletion, and the surface pH remains low, both implying oligotrophic conditions. The heavy wilderness traffic in the area has caused water quality problems. For example, the lake water sometimes has shown evidence of the presence of a few fecal coliform bacteria. It is possible that the heavy recreational use is contributing to increased bacteria and phosphorus in the lake. The lake is presently classified as oligotrophic.</p>

"Bull Run Reservoir Number One","160","<p>
<p>(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). Bull Run Reservoir #1, also known as Lake Ben Morrow, was built on the Bull Run River in 1929 to supplement the water supply for the city of Portland. It lies near the center of the Bull Run Reserve, a restricted area of 214 square miles that provides a reliable supply of clean water for nearly one-third of all Oregonians. To safeguard water quality, the entire reserve is closed to the general public. Hydroelectric generation facilities were installed at the reservoir site in 1982 by Portland General Electric.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bull Run Watershed itself occupies about 50 percent of the Reserve. It is a geologically recent area, underlain by alternating flows of andesite and basalt. Larch Mountain, a beautiful example of a shield volcano built from andesite, rises to the north of the reservoir. The fractured lava flows are effective in storing snowmelt runoff and maintaining a relatively high and steady streamflow in the Bull Run River during the dry summer months. Glaciation during the Pleistocene Epoch played a major role in reshaping this volcanic landscape, and the reservoir is set in an area of loess and glacial till. Slopes around the reservoir are generally steep, and post-glacial stream incision has carved some steep canyons in the headwater portions of the drainage basin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Water in the reservoir is of very high quality, with low conductivity and low alkalinity. Water transparency is also high. Species of diatoms suggestive of mesotrophic conditions have been observed in the water, but populations are low and Bull Run Reservoir #1 &nbsp;is classified as oligotrophic. The water column develops a sharp thermal stratification with water below 30 feet much cooler than surface water during the summer. The only impediment to maintaining the desired high level of water quality in the reservoir is an occasional problem with turbidity. A major portion of the land within the Bull Run Watershed contains relatively stable soils formed from basalt and andesite parent materials. However, soils of silt and clay composition are found in the upper layers sandwiched between the lava flows and are actively being eroded. Although these unstable soils occupy only 1.5 percent of the area, they constitute the greatest hazard for increased turbidity because they are found adjacent to stream channels. The North and South Forks of Bull Run River have cut into these unstable materials, and the turbidity of these streams is noticeably greater than other streams whose channels are formed in harder rock.&nbsp;</p>

"Hyatt Reservoir","212","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Hyatt Reservoir, a large impoundment located just east of the Cascade crest in southern Oregon, was formed in 1923 with the completion of a rock-faced, earthfill dam on Keene Creek. Although developed privately, it now forms an important component of the Talent Division of the Rogue River Basin Project, a multi-purpose water resource project of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. Howard Prairie Lake, the largest reservoir in this project, is three miles to the northeast. These reservoirs, although located in the Klamath drainage basin, store water for transfer and use in the Rogue River drainage basin where they contribute to irrigation of about 35,000 acres in the Medford area. Hyatt Reservoir stores the runoff from the headwaters of Keene Creek and releases them downstream to Little Hyatt Reservoir. From there, the water joins the outflow from Howard Prairie Lake and is transported via the Ashland Lateral Canal to Emigrant Lake, a component of the Project upstream from Medford.</p>
<p>The small, forested drainage basin of Hyatt Reservoir is a mixture of private land and federal land administered by the Bureau of Land Management. The shoreline itself is predominantly federal land and the B.L.M. has designated it as the High Lakes Recreation Site with associated facilities such as campgrounds and boat launches. There is also a private resort on the lake providing recreational services. Hyatt Reservoir has been heavily used for water-based recreation for many years and supports a good population of rainbow and brook trout. It is not fished as much as Howard Prairie Lake, but pressure from anglers has increased in recent years. This entire region of the Southern Oregon Cascades is also quite popular with winter sports enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Hyatt Reservoir is not deep; the average depth is only 18 feet and the water is well-mixed, so that much of the bottom is exposed to warm surface water. Thus, the recycling of algal nutrients is enhanced. Major ion concentrations are somewhat higher than in nearby Howard Prairie Lake, as are conductivity and alkalinity. Water transparency is limited to 5.6 feet (1.7 meters). These factors, combined with chlorophyll and phosphorus concentrations, all suggest a classification as eutrophic. In 1968 the reservoir was treated with the poison rotenone to eliminate rough fish. As a result, the trout population has flourished, a further indication that a productive food chain exists. The reservoir was the site of an illegal attempt to introduce a non-native fish (pike) in 1973. Past experience with introductions of foreign species indicates that they can be an especially dangerous environmental modification. Fortunately, the pike appear not to have survived in Hyatt Reservoir.</p>

"Siltcoos Lake","120","<div>Siltcoos Lake is a large (1280 hectares), shallow (mean depth 3.3 m; maximum depth 6.7 m) lake located on the Central Oregon Coast, just south of Florence and bordered by Dunes City, Oregon. &nbsp;The outflow and water level of Siltcoos Lake is regulated by a dam on the Siltcoos River 4 km upstream from the Pacific. &nbsp;Several permanent streams feed the lake from its 176 square kilometer watershed including Fiddle Creek, Maple Creek, and Woahink Creek, the outflow from Woahink Lake. &nbsp;Much of the watershed is forested and used for timber harvest, residential development, and limited agricultural production.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>The lake is popular for recreational activities, particularly fishing for wild coastal Coho salmon, rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, largemouth bass, bluegill, crappie, and yellow perch (Buckman 2004). The lake is also the domestic drinking water source for approximately 125 of the 1330 residents of Dunes City and numerous residents outside the city limits within Lane and Douglas Counties (LCOG 2002).</div>
<div>During the fall of 2007 a dense bloom of the potentially toxigenic blue-green algal species <em>Anabaena planktonica</em> prompted Dunes City, the South Coast Water District, the Lane County Health Department, and the Oregon Department of Human Services to issue an advisory against usage of Siltcoos Lake water for drinking and other domestic use (DHS 2007). Residents dependent upon Siltcoos Lake were forced to find alternate domestic water sources for a total of 52 days. &nbsp;This incident was part of a long history of water quality problems including dense algal growth and excessive growth of the non-native aquatic macrophytes Brazilian elodea (<em>Egeria densa</em>), parrotsfeather (Myriophyllum aquaticum), and two-leaf water milfoil (<em>Myriophyllum heterophyllum</em>) (Pfauth and Sytsma 2005; Johnson et al. 1985; McHugh 1979). Because of the water quality problems, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) placed the lake the 303(d) list of impaired water bodies; specifically due to violations of the “aquatic weeds and algae” water quality criterion (DEQ 1998; DEQ 2006). &nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Dunes City has acted on water quality concerns for both Siltcoos and Woahink Lakes by issuing a temporary building moratorium (Dunes City 2006a), a septic tank maintenance ordinance (Dunes City 2006b), and an ordinance limiting phosphorus use (Dunes City 2007). Preliminary assessments (Johnson, et al. 1985, LCOG 2002) indicate multiple sources of water quality problems including excess nutrient and/or sediment loading from residential development, poorly functioning on-site septic systems, private forestry and agricultural practices and introductions of non-native aquatic plant species.</div>

"Lake Penland","250","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;Penland Lake is an artificial lake on private land within the Umatilla National Forest boundaries; however, there is public access. The lake was built about 1960 by local interests to serve strictly as a recreation site, and water is not withdrawn for other purposes. The lake is stocked quite heavily with rainbow trout and has proven to be a successful enterprise for local anglers. A good launching site is located at the lake as well as a Forest Service campground. Cutsforth Dam, a 29-foot earthfill structure, impounds the flow of Mallory Creek to submerge a portion of Penland Prairie. There is an additional small dike along the west side of the lake. Outflow into Mallory Creek joins the John Day River about 10 miles downstream. The small drainage basin is a forested area of low relief.</p>
<p>Penland Lake is very shallow, with a mean depth of about eight feet; maximum depth is only 24 feet when full. Macrophytes have encroached on the-lake in shallow areas around much of the shoreline. Alkalinity, conductivity, and concentrations of major ions are moderate for lakes in eastern Oregon, while water transparency, and chlorophyl and phosphorus concentrations are about average and imply a mesotrophic lake. However, the surface water pH (8.0) and the dissolved oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion indicate that Penland Lake may be at the higher end of mesotrophic.</p>

"Mirror Pond","238","<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985)  Mirror pond is a controlled section of the Deschutes River located in the developed portion of the city of Bend. It stretches from the Pacific Power and Light Company Dam to Galveston Avenue, a distance of about one mile. Over the years, private homes have been developed along the pond's edge, primarily on the western side of the river. Drake Park fronts most of the pond on the east side of the river, and three smaller parks border portions of the park on the west side. All of these parks provide public access to the pond area.
Siltation has curtailed much of the former recreational use of Mirror Pond. In addition to reducing depths, siltation has encouraged excessive growth of macrophytes that further interfere with boating, fishing, and swimming and creates unpleasant odors at times. Vegetative growth is related to the shallow depths, which allow sufficient light on the bottom to encourage macrophyte growth. These problems were investigated by an EPA-funded study under the Clean Lakes Program (Winzler and Kelly; Clark and Joyce 1981). They found that there has been no drastic increase in any water quality parameter related to the location within Bend that could contribute to eutrophication. Biological oxygen demand levels upstream and downstream from Bend do not indicate gross organic pollution, but sufficient levels of nitrogen and phosphorus are available in the Deschutes River upstream from Bend to promote eutrophication.
No single source of land use can be blamed for eutrophication or sedimentation problems in the pond. This is due to the fact that the water quality of the pond is essentially that of the Deschutes River which would then reflect any problems from the extensive use of the drainage basin. Likely sources of sediment and pollutants include: natural sediment load, faulty septic systems, agricultural runoff, sediments from failed riverbanks, and turf fertilization. Mirror Pond acts as a settling pond to accept nutrient-enriched sediment from all these sources. Proposed rehabilitation efforts are directed at resolving the primary problem of siltation and the resulting shallow water depths. Some alleviation of the secondary problem of macrophyte growth is expected, but dredging at depths greater than available funds allow would be required to achieve a long-term suppression of plants. Bucket and hydraulic dredging methods were two alternatives examined. Based on lower cost, fewer turbidity problems, and lesser impacts on park and residential areas, hydraulic dredging was selected. Sources of funding are being sought with dredging expected to occur in 1984 depending on sufficient funds and proper conditions to lessen impacts on the fish and wildlife.
From a water quality standpoint, Mirror Pond is essentially an extension of the Deschutes River and reflects the quality of the river at that point. Most of the flow through the pond follows the old river channel and has been further confined by the siltation and macrophyte growth. The pond receives water draining from Wickiup, Crescent, and Paulina Lakes. Average water quality data collected by DEQ from 1979-1983 is presented for a site on the Deschutes River approximately one mile downstream at the Irrigation Division Dam. As shown, ion concentrations are similar, although slightly higher than those found in Wickiup Reservoir and reflect a mix of water draining from the three tributary lake basins. Phosphorus levels are fairly high but are similar to those levels found in lakes from this region of the Cascades. Chlorophyl values are moderate although they have ranged from 0.9 to 21 ug/1. As the pond is shallow and dominated by river flow, it does not stratify. Generally, the pond can be classified as mesotrophic.</p>","AOL000080","","","0","Mirror Pond","1"
"River Mill Reservoir","253","<p>
<p>(From <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985) &nbsp;River Mill Reservoir, known commonly as Estacada Lake, is one of a number of power generating facilities on the Clackamas River operated by Portland General Electric. It was formed by damming the Clackamas River in 1911, and is an extremely narrow and steep sided impoundment. This reservoir raises the water level to provide a drop through the power-house turbines; it has practically no storage capacity. A considerable amount of fishing is done on the reservoir, but it is too small and narrow for much pleasure boating. A small park is maintained by Portland General Electric near the dam on the north side. Facilities are for picnicking only, and there is a boat launching area near the park. The name of the reservoir is due to the existence of a nearby sawmill on the banks of the river.</p>
<p>The chemistry of the water in River Mill Reservoir is typical of drainage basins in the Cascades. The concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyl, and the water transparency suggest mesotrophic ecological conditions. The ""phytoplankton"" are composed almost entirely of diatoms that grow attached to rocks and other substrates in rivers (periphyton). These algae undoubtedly originate from the inflowing Clackamas River, and indicate that residence time of water in this reservoir is short and also that the reservoir has a low biological productivity.</p>

"Antelope Flat Reservoir","148","<p>(From Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Johnson et al. 1985). Antelope Flat Reservoir is an irrigation impoundment on the south side of the Maury Mountains in Central Oregon. It is situated near the headwaters of Bear Creek, a tributary of the Crooked River, and was formed by a 33-foot high earthfill dam at the west end of Antelope Flat. Antelope Flat is the name given the dish-shaped valley that supports an exceptional variety of vegetation, from grassy sagebrush on the lower slopes to sparse juniper stands and pine forest at the higher elevations. The reservoir has a storage capacity of nearly 2000 acre-feet and a surface area of 170 acres when full; but it is often drawn down to less than half that size by late summer to satisfy downstream irrigation needs. Rainbow trout are found in the reservoir and there have been reports of a high growth rate and good success by anglers. Recreation facilites have been provided near the dam, including a good paved boat ramp. There is no campground at the reservoir, but a good one nearby.</p>

<p>The maximum depth of the reservoir is 28 feet at full pool and the average depth is only 11 feet. The water is frequently turbid because of the growth of phytoplankton and because of bank erosion caused by surface waves, thus decreasing water transparency. The concentration of ions is fairly high, characteristic of the semi-arid Crooked River drainage. Alkalinity and conductivity are above average for eastern Oregon reservoirs. The concentration of phosphorus is very high, and chlorophyl is above average. Macrophytes grow in all of the littoral zone, especially at the swampy area near the inflow at the east end of the reservoir. Because of the combination of shallow water and a significant supply of nutrients from the drainage basin, Antelope Flat Reservoir is distinctly eutrophic.</p>

"Emigrant Lake","76","<p>(Adapted from <em>Atlas of Oregon Lakes</em>, Johnson et al. 1985). &nbsp;Emigrant Lake is a reservoir located in the broad valley of Emigrant Creek to the east of Ashland, and was formed in 1926 when the creek was dammed to store water for irrigation and to provide protection from floods. The name is in honor of nineteenth century emigrants who crossed the Cascade Range over the southern route and came down this stream into the Rogue River Valley. Today, the lake is easily observed from Interstate Highway 5 and is generally the first Oregon lake seen by travelers as they enter the state from the south.</p>

<p>In 1960 the dam was raised to a height of 198 feet and the lake enlarged. It now covers a surface area of 878 acres and holds over 40,000 acre feet of water at full pool. Built by the U. S. Bureau of Reclamation, it is operated as a part of the Talent Irrigation Division, a project which includes Howard Prairie Lake, Keene Creek Dam, Agate Lake, and the Green Springs power plant. Howard Prairie Lake and Keene Creek are in the Klamath Basin, and whenever there is surplus water available on the Klamath side of the Cascade divide, it is diverted into Emigrant Lake via Keene Creek diversion dam, the Cascade Divide Tunnel, and the Ashland Lateral Canal. Natural inflow to Emigrant Lake is from an area of 64.3 square miles; primary streams are Hill Creek and Emigrant Creek. Land in the drainage basin is mostly in private ownership, interspersed with federal lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management. The shoreline is entirely under county management as the Emigrant Lake Recreation Area. Outflow is into Emigrant Creek, tributary of Bear Creek, and into the East Lateral Canal. Primary purpose of the waters released from Emigrant Lake is for irrigation downstream in the Talent-Medford area, and as a result the lake fluctuates widely in surface area throughout the year.</p>

<p>Emigrant Lake is also a popular recreation spot. In spring and summer there is heavy use for fishing, boating, and swimming. However, as the seasonal drawdown for irrigation progresses in late summer boat launching ramps and floating docks are left stranded and the remaining water is surrounded by a broad belt of soft mud. Since the early 2000s the Rogue Rowing Club has maintained a dock accessible to the public which is moved down the shoreline slope as the water recedes. This system has enabled rowers to access the water with the reservoir as low as 7 percent full - that is, in a very dry year. The water level does not necessarily fall continuously, because Klamath Basin water is periodically diverted into Emigrant Creek. As long as water levels are up, there is good angling for largemouth bass and crappie, and some rainbow trout are caught. Camping in the Emigrant Lake Recreation Area extends through the whole summer, even when the lake itself is unusable. There is also a large picnic area, a swimming beach, playground facilities, and a boat ramp on the shoreline.</p>

<p>Emigrant Lake exhibits a distinctive branching shape, with two major arms extending up the valleys of Hill Creek and Emigrant Creek. Extensive shallow areas are found in the upper portions of these arms, although three dikes along the northwest edge of the lake reduce the amount of shallow water somewhat. Bottom material consists primarily of clay and fine sediment, which is easily resuspended as the level of the lake varies, and on occasion it reduces water transparency. When there is no direct influence from suspended sediment, transparency is moderate (Secchi disk depth = 8.0 feet; 2.4 meters on 7/12/82). Concentrations of major ions, alkalinity, and conductivity are above average for lakes and reservoirs in the Cascades. Calcium and magnesium, in particular, are well above average, possibly as a result of weathering of clays and sedimentary rock in the basin.</p>

<p>The reservoir has experienced a history of problems with algal blooms. Because it is mud-bottomed and is shallow for much of the year, with consequent rapid warming of the water, there is almost a continuous bloom of blue-green algae during the summer. <em>Aphanizomenon flos-aquae</em> has been commonly observed, approximating a &quot;green paint&quot; condition over much of the reservoir. It is highly unlikely that the frequent blooms are stimulated by direct human agency. Sewage and washing water from campgrounds, picnic areas, and trailer parking areas are either pumped and removed from the drainage or treated in a sewage treatment plant, the effluent from which is sprayed on dry hillsides. The heavy growths of blue-green algae, mostly <em>Aphanizomenon</em>, have discouraged swimming at times and have been the source of complaints about bad odors.</p>

<p>According to McHugh (1979), this reservoir would be a good place to try iron precipitation by the permanganate method, followed by phosphate and manganese precipitation by alum. The objective of iron-alum treatment would be to shift the plankton from blue-green algae to diatoms or green algae, which are less disagreeable, do not produce odors as offensive as those of blue-greens, and do not form the dense floating surface scums that blue-green algae do. Emigrant Lake will probably always have abundant summer algal plankton, as mud-bottomed reservoirs provide nutrients directly from the bottom sediments. Also, the surplus water diverted into Emigrant Lake from the Klamath Basin is well-enriched. Based upon the history of problems with algal blooms, as well as other indices, Emigrant Lake is classified as eutrophic.</p>
